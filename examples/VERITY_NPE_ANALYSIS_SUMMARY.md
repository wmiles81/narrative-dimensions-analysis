## Critical Thresholds

### 🔴 Chapter 17: Dark Night of the Soul (CRISIS)
**Convergence of All Axes:**
- IA: -0.90 (absolute lowest)
- RA_Orbit: 160° (bond breaks, Verity pushes Roric away)
- EA: +1.0 (maximum pressure)
- TA: 0.0 (complete task failure)
- Stakes: 10/10
- Self-worth: 1/10

**Narrative Function**:
Forces Verity to confront her core belief: "I am insufficient." The cookbook locks her out, Jasper nearly fades, and she must choose between self-erasure or self-acceptance.

### 🟡 Chapter 12: Midpoint Revelation (BREAKTHROUGH)
**IA**: -0.15 (major improvement)
**Discovery**: "Recipes heal emotional wounds, not physical hunger"
**Effect**: Shifts entire understanding of magic and purpose

### 🟡 Chapter 20: Relational Breakthrough
**Orbit**: 135° → 90° (45° closure in one chapter)
**Action**: Verity apologizes to Roric, practices emotional honesty
**Effect**: Restoration of primary support relationship

### 🟡 Chapter 22: IA Polarity Flip
**IA crosses 0.0**: Wound → Growth territory
**Catalysts**:
- Wren becomes ally
- External conflict resolved
- Self-worth stabilizes at 8/10

## Entropy Analysis

### Narrative Disorder Curve:
- **Act 1 (Ch 1-6)**: Low entropy (0.2-0.3) - establishing baseline
- **Act 2 (Ch 7-19)**: Rising entropy with spike at Ch 17 (0.87)
- **Act 3 (Ch 20-26)**: Falling entropy, resolving to 0.03

**Peak Entropy**: 0.87 at Chapter 17
- **Cozy Fantasy Constraint**: <0.5
- **Exceeded?**: Yes, but narratively justified
- **Justification**: Dark Night requires emotional crisis; NPE allows temporary genre-bending for transformation moments

**Resolution Entropy**: 0.03 (nearly zero disorder)
- Stakes: 1/10
- Info_asymmetry: 0/10
- Goal_misalignment: 0/10
- **Result**: Perfect cozy landing

## Three-Act Structure

### Act 1 (Chapters 1-6): Setup & Commitment
- **IA Range**: -0.85 → -0.50 (wounded → slightly healing)
- **Key Event**: Jasper trapped → Verity commits
- **Orbital Progress**: 160° → 130° (strangers → acquaintances)
- **Entropy**: Low, establishing cozy baseline

### Act 2 (Chapters 7-19): Complications & Crisis
- **IA Range**: -0.90 → -0.15 (includes dark night at -0.90)
- **Key Events**:

  - Dark night (Ch 17)
  - Spark of redirection (Ch 19)
- **Orbital Progress**: 130° → 105° → 160° → 135° (oscillating)
- **Entropy**: Rising to peak

### Act 3 (Chapters 20-26): Resolution & Transformation
- **IA Range**: -0.25 → +0.75 (healing → wholeness)

  - Reconciliation (Ch 20)
  - Polarity flip (Ch 22)
  - Community awakening (Ch 25)
- **Orbital Progress**: 135° → 60° (rapid intimacy)

2. **Vulnerability**: 2 → 10 (+8 points)
3. **Trust**: 3 → 10 (+7 points)
4. **Intimacy**: 1 → 9 (+8 points)
5. **Goal_alignment**: 5 → 10 (+5 points)

## NPE Physics Observations

### 1. **Orbital Resonance**
The RA orbit and IA values show strong correlation:
- When IA improves, orbit closes
- When IA crashes (Ch 17), orbit widens to 160°
- **Interpretation**: Verity's internal state directly affects relational capacity

### 2. **Axis Interference Patterns**
**Constructive Interference** (tension-building):
- Chapters 15-17: EA pressure + IA collapse + RA disruption = crisis

**Destructive Interference** (tension-resolving):
- Chapters 20-22: IA rising + RA harmonizing + EA stabilizing = healing

### 3. **Waveform Harmonics**
IA oscillates around a rising trendline with two major dips:
- **Dip 1**: Chapter 4 (-0.78) - first recipe failure
- **Dip 2**: Chapter 17 (-0.90) - dark night

Both dips followed by rebounds, showing resilience pattern.

### 4. **Entropy Phase Transitions**
- **0.0-0.3**: Cozy equilibrium
- **0.3-0.6**: Moderate tension (acceptable for cozy)
- **0.6-0.9**: High tension (crisis territory)
- **0.9+**: Extreme (dark night only)

Verity's entropy stays within cozy ranges except for the justified Ch 17 spike.

## Comparison: NPE vs. Traditional Dimensions

### What NPE Adds:
1. **Composite Metrics**: IA combines self-worth + vulnerability + trust into single axis
2. **Geometric Relationships**: Orbital distance more intuitive than raw intimacy scores
3. **Physics Metaphors**: Interference, entropy, waveforms provide narrative logic
4. **Polarity Tracking**: -1/+1 scale makes wound → growth explicit

### What Dimensions Provide:
1. **Granular Detail**: Separate tracking of 10+ dimensions
2. **Genre Formulas**: Tension calculations tuned per genre
3. **Diagnostic Patterns**: Automated issue detection
4. **Visualizations**: Graph individual dimension trajectories

### Optimal Use:
- **NPE**: High-level story physics and arc planning
- **Dimensions**: Scene-level execution and diagnostic validation
- **Together**: NPE for structure, Dimensions for implementation

## Key Insights for Writers

### 1. The Dark Night Requirement
- NPE correctly predicts need for IA nadir around 70-80% mark
- Entropy spike validates emotional necessity
- Orbital separation shows relational stakes

### 2. Polarity Flip Timing
- IA crosses 0.0 at Chapter 22 (85% through book)
- Aligns with Act 3 transformation
- Provides satisfying late-book shift

### 3. Cozy Genre Compliance
- Low-frequency waveforms maintained (slow, gentle)
- Entropy kept low except justified crisis
- Resolution brings true stability (entropy → 0.03)

### 4. Relational Arc Pacing
- Orbital closure is non-linear (rapid in Act 3)
- Dark night separation necessary for stakes
- Final 60° represents genuine intimacy (not rushed)

## Conclusion

Verity's trajectory demonstrates textbook NPE physics:
- **Internal transformation** (-0.85 → +0.75)
- **Relational deepening** (160° → 60°)
- **Task completion** (0.1 → 1.0)
- **Entropy management** (cozy-appropriate with justified spike)

The framework successfully tracks a complex emotional journey while maintaining cozy fantasy genre constraints. The dark night at Chapter 17 is the calculated low point across all four axes, creating maximum narrative tension before the transformative final act.

**Genre Classification**: ✓ Cozy Fantasy (with emotionally rich arc)
**Arc Completion**: ✓ Full transformation achieved
**Physics Compliance**: ✓ All axes resolve harmoniously
**Reader Experience**: Warm, hopeful, emotionally satisfying
