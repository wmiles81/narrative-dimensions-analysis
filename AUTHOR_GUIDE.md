# Author's Guide to Narrative Dimensions Analysis
## Using This Framework in Claude Chat (No Coding Required!)

---

## What This Tool Does (In Plain English)

Think of your story as a journey through emotional space. This framework helps you:

- **Plan** character arcs that feel earned and satisfying
- **Diagnose** why a scene feels flat or rushed
- **Validate** that your story matches genre expectations
- **Fix** pacing problems before beta readers see them

**No coding required.** You just have conversations with Claude.

## Quick Start: Three Ways to Use This

### 1. **Planning a New Story**

Copy and paste this template into Claude Chat:

```
I'm planning a [GENRE] story. Help me design the character arc using
the narrative dimensions framework.

Genre: [cozy fantasy / dark romance / thriller / etc.]
Length: [number of chapters/acts]

Main character starts: [brief emotional state]
Main character ends: [brief emotional state]

Key relationship: [who with whom]

What should the dimensional trajectory look like?
Where should the "dark night" moment happen?
```

**Example:**
```
I'm planning a cozy fantasy story. Help me design the character arc
using the narrative dimensions framework.

Genre: Cozy fantasy
Length: 20 chapters

Main character starts: Isolated librarian, feels inadequate
Main character ends: Confident, belongs to community

Key relationship: With grumpy baker who becomes love interest

What should the dimensional trajectory look like?
Where should the "dark night" moment happen?
```

---

### 2. **Diagnosing a Problem Scene**

When something feels "off":

```
This scene feels [flat/rushed/confusing]. Can you diagnose it using
narrative dimensions?

Scene: [brief description]

Current emotional state:
- How close are they? [1-10]
- Do they trust each other? [1-10]
- What are the stakes? [1-10]
- Is there conflict? [yes/no, describe]

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

**Example:**
```
This scene feels flat. Can you diagnose it using narrative dimensions?

Scene: Hero and mentor talk about the quest over dinner

Current emotional state:
- How close are they? 6
- Do they trust each other? 7
- What are the stakes? 3
- Is there conflict? No, they agree on everything

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

---

### 3. **Validating Your Genre**

Check if your story matches genre expectations:

```
I'm writing a [GENRE]. Does this arc match the genre physics?

Act 1: [brief emotional summary]
Act 2: [brief emotional summary]
Act 3: [brief emotional summary]

Darkest moment: [when and what happens]
Ending state: [how characters end up]

Does this trajectory work for [GENRE]?
```

## The Five Dimensions You Need to Know

You don't need to track all the technical stuff. Focus on these five:

### 1. **Intimacy** (0-10)
How emotionally close are the characters?
- 0 = Strangers
- 5 = Friends
- 10 = Soul-deep connection

### 2. **Trust** (0-10)
Do they believe in each other?
- 0 = Complete distrust
- 5 = Cautious
- 10 = Total faith

### 3. **Stakes** (0-10)
How much is at risk?
- 0 = Nothing matters
- 5 = Moderate consequences
- 10 = Everything on the line

### 4. **Desire/Goal Alignment** (0-10)
Do they want the same thing?
- 0 = Complete opposition
- 5 = Partial overlap
- 10 = Perfect alignment

### 5. **Vulnerability** (0-10)
Are their emotional walls up or down?
- 0 = Completely guarded
- 5 = Cautiously open
- 10 = Fully exposed

**That's it!** Track these five and Claude can calculate everything else.

## Common Conversations with Claude

### "Why Does My Romance Feel Flat?"

**You say:**
```
My romance feels flat around chapter 10. Current state:

Intimacy: 7
Trust: 7
Desire: 8
Vulnerability: 7
Stakes: 3

They're getting along fine but there's no tension. What's wrong?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
The problem is everything is too harmonious. Romance needs gaps:

- High desire (8) but low proximity = yearning
- High vulnerability (7) but low trust = risk
- Or misaligned goals = conflict

Your stakes are also too low (3). Try:
- Stakes: 7 (raise external pressure)
- Trust: 4 (introduce a secret or misunderstanding)
- Vulnerability: 8 (keep this high so betrayal hurts)

This creates the "vulnerability-trust gap" that generates romantic tension.
```

---

### "Where Should the Dark Night Happen?"

**You say:**
```
I'm writing a 24-chapter cozy mystery. When should my protagonist
hit rock bottom? What should it look like dimensionally?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
For cozy mystery, the "dark night" should happen around Chapter 18
(75% through).

It should look like:
- Self-worth: drops to 2-3 (doubts competence)
- Stakes: peak at 8-9 (mystery seems unsolvable)
- Trust: maybe drops if she suspects wrong person
- Info asymmetry: still high (hasn't figured it out yet)

But keep it "cozy":
- Don't make it traumatic (stakes ≤9, not 10)
- Community support is nearby
- Reader knows it will resolve warmly

After this low point, she gets the crucial clue around Chapter 20.
```

---

### "Is This Too Intense for Cozy Fantasy?"

**You say:**
```
I'm worried my cozy fantasy is too dark. My "dark night" has:

- Protagonist completely breaks down
- Stakes at 10 (life or death)
- Trust crashes from 7 to 0
- Feels like everything is lost

Is this too much for cozy?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
Yes, that's thriller physics, not cozy. For cozy fantasy:

Maximum darkness should be:
- Stakes: 6-7 (personal, not life/death)
- Trust: drops to 3-4 (strained, not shattered)
- Character feels "inadequate" not "destroyed"

Cozy dark night = "I can't do this" + cup of tea
Thriller dark night = "Everyone will die" + no hope

Soften yours by:
- Lower the stakes (relationships at risk, not lives)
- Keep community support visible
- Have the "comfort" element present even in crisis
```

---

### "How Do I Fix Pacing?"

**You say:**
```
Chapters 8-12 drag. Nothing seems to happen. How do I fix pacing
using this framework?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
Pacing = how fast dimensions change. If chapters drag, dimensions
are stuck.

Check: What changed from Chapter 8 → 12?
- Intimacy: 5 → 5 (stuck!)
- Trust: 6 → 6 (stuck!)
- Stakes: 4 → 4 (stuck!)

**Fix: Move 2-3 dimensions per chapter**

Chapter 8 → 9:
- Intimacy: 5 → 6 (shared vulnerable moment)
- Stakes: 4 → 6 (external complication)

Chapter 9 → 10:
- Trust: 6 → 5 (small misunderstanding)
- Desire: 7 → 8 (proximity increases)

Chapter 10 → 11:
- Intimacy: 6 → 7 (confession)
- Trust: 5 → 7 (misunderstanding cleared)

Now it feels like progress!
```

## Workflows for Different Stages

### **Planning (Before You Write)**

**Step 1:** Describe your story to Claude
```
I'm writing a [genre] about [premise]. Main character [starts here]
and ends [here]. It's [X] chapters long.
```

**Step 2:** Ask for dimensional roadmap
```
What should the chapter-by-chapter progression look like?
When should key moments happen (dark night, turning points)?
```

**Step 3:** Get specific targets
```
For the dark night (Chapter X), what should the dimensions be?
For the ending (Chapter Y), what values ensure proper resolution?
```

---

### **Drafting (While You Write)**

Every 5-10 chapters, check in:

```
I just finished Chapter [X]. Current state:

Intimacy: [number]
Trust: [number]
Stakes: [number]

Does this match where I should be for [genre]?
What should happen next?
```

---

### **Revising (After First Draft)**

**Step 1:** Identify problem areas
```
Beta readers say:
- Act 2 drags
- The ending feels rushed
- The romance lacks chemistry

Can you diagnose these using narrative dimensions?
```

**Step 2:** Get specific fixes
```
For the "Act 2 drags" problem, what dimensions need to move?
Show me chapter-by-chapter adjustments.
```

**Step 3:** Validate changes
```
I made these changes:
[describe dimensional shifts]

Does this fix the pacing problem?
```

## FAQs

### "Do I need to track numbers for every chapter?"
**No!** Just at key moments:
- Opening
- End of Act 1
- Midpoint
- Dark night
- Climax
- Ending

### "What if I don't know the exact numbers?"
**That's fine!** Just describe it:
- "They're getting closer but still cautious" = Intimacy ~5-6, Trust ~5
- "High stakes, everything matters" = Stakes 8-9
- "Total strangers" = Intimacy 0-1

Claude can translate descriptions to numbers.

### "Do I have to use all the dimensions?"
**No!** Start with the five basics:
1. Intimacy
2. Trust
3. Stakes
4. Goal alignment
5. Vulnerability

Add others (danger, mystery, power differential) only if relevant to your genre.

### "What if my story doesn't fit a single genre?"
**Tell Claude you're blending!**
```
I'm writing a romantic thriller (60% thriller, 40% romance).
What physics constraints apply?
```

### "Can I ignore the 'physics' stuff and just get advice?"
**Absolutely!** You can ask in plain English:
```
My protagonist feels stuck. How do I make her grow?
```

Claude will apply the framework behind the scenes.

## Example Full Conversation

**You:**
```
I'm stuck on Chapter 15 of my cozy fantasy. My librarian protagonist
just discovered her familiar is trapped in a magical book. She tried
to free him and failed.

She feels defeated and incompetent. Is this the right time for the
dark night? Should she feel THIS low?

Story is 26 chapters total.
```

**Claude:**
```
Let me check this against cozy fantasy physics:

Chapter 15 / 26 = 58% through the story
Cozy fantasy dark night should happen: 70-75% (Chapters 18-20)

This is too early! Here's what to do:

**Chapter 15 (current):**
- This should be a setback, not the dark night
- Self-worth drops to 4-5 (frustrated, not defeated)
- She should feel "this is harder than I thought"
- NOT "I can't do this"

**Build to dark night at Chapter 18:**
- Ch 15: First failure (setback)
- Ch 16-17: She tries new approaches, makes progress
- Ch 18: DARK NIGHT - bigger failure, questions everything
- Self-worth: 2-3 (now she really doubts)

**Why this matters:**
- Too early = reader loses hope too long
- Cozy needs hope visible even in crisis
- Setback ≠ dark night

**Fix for Chapter 15:**
Add a small comfort:
- A friend brings her tea
- She finds a clue in an old book
- The familiar leaves her an encouraging note

This keeps it cozy even in difficulty.
```

**You:**
```
Perfect! So Chapter 15 is a setback. What should the dimensions look
like here vs. Chapter 18 dark night?
```

**Claude:**
```
Chapter 15 (Setback):
- Self-worth: 4 (frustrated but not broken)
- Stakes: 6 (familiar trapped but not deteriorating yet)
- Trust in herself: 5 (doubts but hasn't given up)
- Community support: 7 (Roric still helping)

Chapter 18 (Dark Night):
- Self-worth: 2 (deeply doubts competence)
- Stakes: 9 (familiar starting to fade)
- Trust in herself: 2 (wants to give up)
- Community support: 6 (she pushes Roric away)

The key difference:
- Ch 15: "This is hard" + still trying
- Ch 18: "I'm the problem" + considers quitting

Recovery (Ch 19-20):
- Community pulls her back
- She realizes it's not about being magical, it's about connection
- Self-worth: 2 → 5 (starts healing)
```
