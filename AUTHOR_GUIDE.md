# Author's Guide to Narrative Dimensions Analysis
## Using This Framework in Claude Chat (No Coding Required!)

---

## What This Tool Does (In Plain English)

Think of your story as a journey through emotional space. This framework helps you:

- **Plan** character arcs that feel earned and satisfying
- **Diagnose** why a scene feels flat or rushed
- **Validate** that your story matches genre expectations
- **Fix** pacing problems before beta readers see them

**No coding required.** You just have conversations with Claude.

## Quick Start: Three Ways to Use This

### 1. **Planning a New Story**

Copy and paste this template into Claude Chat:

```
I'm planning a [GENRE] story. Help me design the character arc using
the narrative dimensions framework.

Genre: [cozy fantasy / dark romance / thriller / etc.]
Length: [number of chapters/acts]

Main character starts: [brief emotional state]
Main character ends: [brief emotional state]

Key relationship: [who with whom]

What should the dimensional trajectory look like?
Where should the "dark night" moment happen?
```

**Example:**
```
I'm planning a cozy fantasy story. Help me design the character arc
using the narrative dimensions framework.

Genre: Cozy fantasy
Length: 20 chapters

Main character starts: Isolated librarian, feels inadequate
Main character ends: Confident, belongs to community

Key relationship: With grumpy baker who becomes love interest

What should the dimensional trajectory look like?
Where should the "dark night" moment happen?
```

---

### 2. **Diagnosing a Problem Scene**

When something feels "off":

```
This scene feels [flat/rushed/confusing]. Can you diagnose it using
narrative dimensions?

Scene: [brief description]

Current emotional state:
- How close are they? [1-10]
- Do they trust each other? [1-10]
- What are the stakes? [1-10]
- Is there conflict? [yes/no, describe]

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

**Example:**
```
This scene feels flat. Can you diagnose it using narrative dimensions?

Scene: Hero and mentor talk about the quest over dinner

Current emotional state:
- How close are they? 6
- Do they trust each other? 7
- What are the stakes? 3
- Is there conflict? No, they agree on everything

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

---

### 3. **Validating Your Genre**

Check if your story matches genre expectations:

```
I'm writing a [GENRE]. Does this arc match the genre physics?

Act 1: [brief emotional summary]
Act 2: [brief emotional summary]
Act 3: [brief emotional summary]

Darkest moment: [when and what happens]
Ending state: [how characters end up]

Does this trajectory work for [GENRE]?
```

## The Five Dimensions You Need to Know

You don't need to track all the technical stuff. Focus on these five:

### 1. **Intimacy** (0-10)
How emotionally close are the characters?
- 0 = Strangers
- 5 = Friends
- 10 = Soul-deep connection

### 2. **Trust** (0-10)
Do they believe in each other?
- 0 = Complete distrust
- 5 = Cautious
- 10 = Total faith

### 3. **Stakes** (0-10)
How much is at risk?
- 0 = Nothing matters
- 5 = Moderate consequences
- 10 = Everything on the line

### 4. **Desire/Goal Alignment** (0-10)
Do they want the same thing?
- 0 = Complete opposition
- 5 = Partial overlap
- 10 = Perfect alignment

### 5. **Vulnerability** (0-10)
Are their emotional walls up or down?
- 0 = Completely guarded
- 5 = Cautiously open
- 10 = Fully exposed

**That's it!** Track these five and Claude can calculate everything else.

## Common Conversations with Claude

### "Why Does My Romance Feel Flat?"

**You say:**
```
My romance feels flat around chapter 10. Current state:

Intimacy: 7
Trust: 7
Desire: 8
Vulnerability: 7
Stakes: 3

They're getting along fine but there's no tension. What's wrong?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
The problem is everything is too harmonious. Romance needs gaps:

- High desire (8) but low proximity = yearning
- High vulnerability (7) but low trust = risk
- Or misaligned goals = conflict

Your stakes are also too low (3). Try:
- Stakes: 7 (raise external pressure)
- Trust: 4 (introduce a secret or misunderstanding)
- Vulnerability: 8 (keep this high so betrayal hurts)

This creates the "vulnerability-trust gap" that generates romantic tension.
```

---

### "Where Should the Dark Night Happen?"

**You say:**
```
I'm writing a 24-chapter cozy mystery. When should my protagonist
hit rock bottom? What should it look like dimensionally?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
For cozy mystery, the "dark night" should happen around Chapter 18
(75% through).

It should look like:
- Self-worth: drops to 2-3 (doubts competence)
- Stakes: peak at 8-9 (mystery seems unsolvable)
- Trust: maybe drops if she suspects wrong person
- Info asymmetry: still high (hasn't figured it out yet)

But keep it "cozy":
- Don't make it traumatic (stakes ≤9, not 10)
- Community support is nearby
- Reader knows it will resolve warmly

After this low point, she gets the crucial clue around Chapter 20.
```

---

### "Is This Too Intense for Cozy Fantasy?"

**You say:**
```
I'm worried my cozy fantasy is too dark. My "dark night" has:

- Protagonist completely breaks down
- Stakes at 10 (life or death)
- Trust crashes from 7 to 0
- Feels like everything is lost

Is this too much for cozy?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
Yes, that's thriller physics, not cozy. For cozy fantasy:

Maximum darkness should be:
- Stakes: 6-7 (personal, not life/death)
- Trust: drops to 3-4 (strained, not shattered)
- Character feels "inadequate" not "destroyed"

Cozy dark night = "I can't do this" + cup of tea
Thriller dark night = "Everyone will die" + no hope

Soften yours by:
- Lower the stakes (relationships at risk, not lives)
- Keep community support visible
- Have the "comfort" element present even in crisis
```

---

### "How Do I Fix Pacing?"

**You say:**
```
Chapters 8-12 drag. Nothing seems to happen. How do I fix pacing
using this framework?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
Pacing = how fast dimensions change. If chapters drag, dimensions
are stuck.

Check: What changed from Chapter 8 → 12?
- Intimacy: 5 → 5 (stuck!)
- Trust: 6 → 6 (stuck!)
- Stakes: 4 → 4 (stuck!)

**Fix: Move 2-3 dimensions per chapter**

Chapter 8 → 9:
- Intimacy: 5 → 6 (shared vulnerable moment)
- Stakes: 4 → 6 (external complication)

Chapter 9 → 10:
- Trust: 6 → 5 (small misunderstanding)
- Desire: 7 → 8 (proximity increases)

Chapter 10 → 11:
- Intimacy: 6 → 7 (confession)
- Trust: 5 → 7 (misunderstanding cleared)

Now it feels like progress!
```

## Workflows for Different Stages

### **Planning (Before You Write)**

**Step 1:** Describe your story to Claude
```
I'm writing a [genre] about [premise]. Main character [starts here]
and ends [here]. It's [X] chapters long.
```

**Step 2:** Ask for dimensional roadmap
```
What should the chapter-by-chapter progression look like?
When should key moments happen (dark night, turning points)?
```

**Step 3:** Get specific targets
```
For the dark night (Chapter X), what should the dimensions be?
For the ending (Chapter Y), what values ensure proper resolution?
```

---

### **Drafting (While You Write)**

Every 5-10 chapters, check in:

```
I just finished Chapter [X]. Current state:

Intimacy: [number]
Trust: [number]
Stakes: [number]

Does this match where I should be for [genre]?
What should happen next?
```

---

### **Revising (After First Draft)**

**Step 1:** Identify problem areas
```
Beta readers say:
- Act 2 drags
- The ending feels rushed
- The romance lacks chemistry

Can you diagnose these using narrative dimensions?
```

**Step 2:** Get specific fixes
```
For the "Act 2 drags" problem, what dimensions need to move?
Show me chapter-by-chapter adjustments.
```

**Step 3:** Validate changes
```
I made these changes:
[describe dimensional shifts]

Does this fix the pacing problem?
```

## The Narrative Physics Engine (NPE): Big Picture Arc Planning

### What's the Difference Between Dimensions and NPE?

Think of it like this:

**Dimensions** = Scene-by-scene, chapter-by-chapter tracking
- "Is this scene working?"
- "Why does Chapter 10 feel flat?"
- Zoomed in, detailed

**NPE** = Big picture, whole-arc physics
- "Does my overall character arc work?"
- "Is my genre physics correct?"
- Zoomed out, structural

**You can use both, or just one, or neither!** They're tools, not rules.

---

### The Four NPE Axes (In Plain English)

Instead of tracking 9+ dimensions, NPE tracks 4 composite axes:

#### 1. **IA (Internal Axis)**: Is your character wounded or whole?
Scale: -1 (broken) to +1 (healed)

- **-1 to 0**: Wounded, broken, in denial
  - Example: "I'm not good enough" / "I don't deserve love"
- **0**: The turning point (Polarity Flip)
  - Example: "Maybe I can change" / First moment of hope
- **0 to +1**: Healing, growing, becoming whole
  - Example: "I am worthy" / "I belong"

**For authors:** Track how broken your character starts and how healed they end.

#### 2. **RA (Relational Axis)**: How far apart are they?
Scale: 0° (together) to 180° (broken apart)

Think of it like distance around a circle:
- **0-30°**: Close, intimate, together
- **90°**: Maximum tension, perpendicular
- **160-180°**: Distant, broken, separated

**For authors:** Track the relationship distance from start to end.

#### 3. **EA (Environmental Axis)**: How much external pressure?
Scale: -1 (low) to +1 (high)

- **Low (around 0)**: Peaceful, safe circumstances
- **High (around 1.0)**: Intense external pressure, danger, world stakes

**For authors:** Track how much the world is pushing on your character.

#### 4. **TA (Task Axis)**: Is the quest progressing?
Scale: 0 (not started) to 1 (complete)

- **0**: Quest not started or failing
- **0.5**: Midpoint, making progress
- **1.0**: Quest complete, goal achieved

**For authors:** Track plot/quest completion.

---

### NPE Genre Physics (The Simple Version)

Different genres have different "physics rules" for how much characters can swing emotionally:

#### **Cozy Fantasy / Cozy Mystery**
- ✓ Must start wounded (-0.8) and end healed (+0.7 or better)
- ✓ Emotional swings stay gentle (max amplitude: 1.5)
- ✓ Even the dark night isn't traumatic
- ✓ Must cross zero (polarity flip required)

#### **Psychological Thriller / Horror**
- ✓ Can have intense emotional swings (max amplitude: 2.5)
- ✓ Can end wounded (doesn't need to cross zero)
- ✓ High chaos allowed
- ✓ Dark night can be devastating

#### **Dark Romance**
- ✓ Intense emotional swings (max amplitude: 2.0)
- ✓ Must cross zero, but late (80%+ through story)
- ✓ Can sustain high tension longer
- ✓ Must end healed for the relationship to work

#### **Romantic Comedy**
- ✓ Moderate swings (max amplitude: 1.8)
- ✓ Rapid oscillation (lots of ups and downs)
- ✓ Must cross zero early-ish
- ✓ Low chaos overall

### NPE Templates for Claude Chat

#### Template: NPE Arc Planning

```
I'm planning a [GENRE] story. Help me design the NPE arc.

Genre: [cozy fantasy / dark romance / thriller / etc.]
Chapters: [number]

Main character starts:
- IA (internal state): [wounded / broken / in denial]
- RA (relationship distance): [far apart / strangers / separated]

Main character ends:
- IA: [healed / whole / self-aware]
- RA: [close / intimate / together]

Where should the polarity flip happen (when IA crosses zero)?
Where should the dark night be?
Does this match [GENRE] physics?
```

**Example:**
```
I'm planning a cozy fantasy story. Help me design the NPE arc.

Genre: Cozy fantasy
Chapters: 26

Main character (Verity) starts:
- IA: Very wounded, feels inadequate as a librarian
- RA: Distant from love interest (grumpy baker Roric)

Main character ends:
- IA: Healed, confident, belongs in community
- RA: Close, romantic relationship with Roric

Where should the polarity flip happen (when IA crosses zero)?
Where should the dark night be?
Does this match cozy fantasy physics?
```

### Common NPE Conversations

#### "When Should the Polarity Flip Happen?"

**You say:**
```
I'm writing a 24-chapter cozy mystery. My protagonist starts feeling
inadequate (IA around -0.7). When should she cross zero to start healing?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
For cozy mystery, the polarity flip should happen around 75-80%:

Chapter 1-17: IA stays negative (wounded, doubting)
Chapter 18: Dark night (IA drops to -0.9)
Chapter 19-20: Recovery begins
Chapter 20: POLARITY FLIP (IA crosses 0)
Chapter 20-24: IA rises to +0.6 or +0.7 (healed)

The flip happens AFTER the dark night, during recovery.

Why this matters:
- Too early = no tension in Act 3
- Too late = feels rushed
- Cozy needs time to savor the healing
```

---

#### "Is This Too Intense for My Genre?"

**You say:**
```
I'm writing cozy fantasy. My dark night has the protagonist completely
shattered (IA drops from -0.5 to -0.95), relationships break apart
(RA jumps to 180°), and she considers leaving town forever.

Is this too dark for cozy?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
That's on the edge! Let's check cozy fantasy physics:

✓ IA drop to -0.95: Acceptable (barely)
✗ RA jump to 180°: Too severe
   - Cozy allows RA up to ~160° max
   - 180° = complete bond break (thriller territory)

✗ "Leaving forever": Too extreme
   - Cozy dark night = "I need a break"
   - Thriller dark night = "I'm leaving forever"

**Soften it:**
- IA: -0.90 (deeply wounded but not shattered)
- RA: 160° (very distant but bond not broken)
- She retreats to her cottage, but community still checks on her
- Keeps the cozy safety net visible even in crisis
```

---

#### "Multi-Genre: How Do I Blend Physics?"

**You say:**
```
I'm writing a romantic thriller (60% thriller, 40% romance).
What physics constraints apply?
```

**Claude might say:**
```
Romantic thriller blends two sets of physics:

From THRILLER:
- Higher amplitude allowed (up to 2.0)
- Sustained high stakes
- Can have intense IA swings

From ROMANCE:
- MUST cross zero (polarity flip required)
- MUST end healed (IA positive)
- RA must close (relationship must work)

Your constraints:
- Amplitude: 2.0 max (higher than pure romance's 1.8)
- IA must cross zero around 75-80%
- Can sustain high chaos (entropy up to 0.8)
- Dark night can be intense but character must heal

Think: The thriller creates the chaos, the romance creates the healing.
```

---

### NPE + Dimensions: How They Work Together

You don't have to choose! They complement each other:

**Use NPE when:**
- Planning the overall arc
- Checking genre compliance
- Finding the dark night / polarity flip
- Making sure the ending works

**Use Dimensions when:**
- Diagnosing a specific scene
- Engineering tension in a chapter
- Fixing pacing problems
- Scene-by-scene tracking

**Example workflow:**

1. **Planning stage**: Use NPE
   ```
   "Plan my cozy fantasy NPE arc for 20 chapters"
   ```

2. **Drafting stage**: Use dimensions
   ```
   "Chapter 8 feels flat, diagnose using dimensions"
   ```

3. **Revision stage**: Check both
   ```
   "Does my overall arc match cozy fantasy NPE physics?
   And does Chapter 12 have enough dimensional movement?"
   ```

### Example NPE Conversation (Full)

**You:**
```
I'm planning a 26-chapter cozy fantasy. Librarian protagonist (Verity)
starts feeling inadequate and isolated. She ends confident and in love
with the grumpy baker.

Help me plan the NPE arc. When should she cross zero? When's the dark night?
```

**Claude:**
```
Great setup! Here's your NPE arc for cozy fantasy:

CHAPTER 1 (Opening):
- IA: -0.85 (wounded, feels inadequate)
- RA: 160° (distant from baker, they bicker)
- EA: 0.3 (low stakes, cozy setting)
- TA: 0 (no quest yet)

CHAPTER 8-10 (End of Act 1):
- IA: -0.70 (still wounded but small growth)
- RA: 140° (slightly closer, bickering softens)
- EA: 0.5 (stakes rising, mystery emerges)
- TA: 0.2 (quest beginning)

CHAPTER 17 (DARK NIGHT - 65% through):
- IA: -0.90 (LOWEST POINT - doubts everything)
- RA: 160° (pushed baker away)
- EA: 1.0 (external pressure peaks)
- TA: 0 (quest seems impossible)

CHAPTER 22 (POLARITY FLIP - 85% through):
- IA: 0 → +0.2 (CROSSES ZERO - first real hope)
- RA: 90° (perpendicular but tension shifting)
- EA: 0.6 (stakes easing)
- TA: 0.5 (breakthrough on quest)

CHAPTER 26 (ENDING):
- IA: +0.75 (healed, confident, belongs)
- RA: 60° (close, romantic, together)
- EA: 0.2 (peaceful, cozy)
- TA: 0.9 (quest complete)

PHYSICS CHECK:
✓ Crosses zero: Yes (Chapter 22)
✓ Amplitude: 1.65 (slightly over but justified by story)
✓ Dark night at 65%: Perfect for cozy
✓ Ends healed: Yes (IA +0.75)
✓ Relationship closes: Yes (160° → 60° = 100° closure)

This matches cozy fantasy physics!
```

**You:**
```
Perfect! What should Chapter 17 (dark night) actually look like in terms
of story events?
```

**Claude:**
```
Chapter 17 dark night for cozy fantasy should include:

EMOTIONAL STATE:
- Verity doubts her competence (IA: -0.90)
- Feels she's failing everyone
- Has pushed Roric away (RA: 160°)
- Quest seems impossible

COZY CONSTRAINTS:
✓ She's sad, not destroyed
✓ Community still cares (even if she can't see it)
✓ Physical comfort present (cottage, tea, familiar nearby)
✓ Reader knows it will resolve warmly

STORY EVENTS:
- Major setback in solving the mystery
- Roric tries to help, she snaps at him
- She retreats to her cottage
- Sits alone with tea, staring at books
- Maybe familiar tries to comfort her
- She thinks: "I'm not good enough for this"

NOT COZY (avoid these):
✗ Complete breakdown
✗ Life-or-death stakes
✗ Destroying relationships permanently
✗ Traumatic events
✗ No comfort elements

The difference:
- Cozy dark night = "I can't do this" + cup of tea + cat purring
- Thriller dark night = "Everyone will die" + no hope
```

## FAQs

### "Do I need to track numbers for every chapter?"
**No!** Just at key moments:
- Opening
- End of Act 1
- Midpoint
- Dark night
- Climax
- Ending

### "What if I don't know the exact numbers?"
**That's fine!** Just describe it:
- "They're getting closer but still cautious" = Intimacy ~5-6, Trust ~5
- "High stakes, everything matters" = Stakes 8-9
- "Total strangers" = Intimacy 0-1

Claude can translate descriptions to numbers.

### "Do I have to use all the dimensions?"
**No!** Start with the five basics:
1. Intimacy
2. Trust
3. Stakes
4. Goal alignment
5. Vulnerability

Add others (danger, mystery, power differential) only if relevant to your genre.

### "What if my story doesn't fit a single genre?"
**Tell Claude you're blending!**
```
I'm writing a romantic thriller (60% thriller, 40% romance).
What physics constraints apply?
```

### "Can I ignore the 'physics' stuff and just get advice?"
**Absolutely!** You can ask in plain English:
```
My protagonist feels stuck. How do I make her grow?
```

Claude will apply the framework behind the scenes.

## What You DON'T Need to Do

❌ Run Python scripts
❌ Install software
❌ Understand waveforms or entropy
❌ Calculate anything manually
❌ Create JSON files
❌ Use command line

**You just talk to Claude in plain English.**

The framework is Claude's "analysis glasses" - you don't need to see through them, just benefit from what Claude sees.

## Example Full Conversation

**You:**
```
I'm stuck on Chapter 15 of my cozy fantasy. My librarian protagonist
just discovered her familiar is trapped in a magical book. She tried
to free him and failed.

She feels defeated and incompetent. Is this the right time for the
dark night? Should she feel THIS low?

Story is 26 chapters total.
```

**Claude:**
```
Let me check this against cozy fantasy physics:

Chapter 15 / 26 = 58% through the story
Cozy fantasy dark night should happen: 70-75% (Chapters 18-20)

This is too early! Here's what to do:

**Chapter 15 (current):**
- This should be a setback, not the dark night
- Self-worth drops to 4-5 (frustrated, not defeated)
- She should feel "this is harder than I thought"
- NOT "I can't do this"

**Build to dark night at Chapter 18:**
- Ch 15: First failure (setback)
- Ch 16-17: She tries new approaches, makes progress
- Ch 18: DARK NIGHT - bigger failure, questions everything
- Self-worth: 2-3 (now she really doubts)

**Why this matters:**
- Too early = reader loses hope too long
- Cozy needs hope visible even in crisis
- Setback ≠ dark night

**Fix for Chapter 15:**
Add a small comfort:
- A friend brings her tea
- She finds a clue in an old book
- The familiar leaves her an encouraging note

This keeps it cozy even in difficulty.
```

Perfect! So Chapter 15 is a setback. What should the dimensions look
like here vs. Chapter 18 dark night?
```

**Claude:**
```
Chapter 15 (Setback):
- Self-worth: 4 (frustrated but not broken)
- Stakes: 6 (familiar trapped but not deteriorating yet)
- Trust in herself: 5 (doubts but hasn't given up)
- Community support: 7 (Roric still helping)

Chapter 18 (Dark Night):
- Self-worth: 2 (deeply doubts competence)
- Stakes: 9 (familiar starting to fade)
- Trust in herself: 2 (wants to give up)
- Community support: 6 (she pushes Roric away)

The key difference:
- Ch 15: "This is hard" + still trying
- Ch 18: "I'm the problem" + considers quitting

Recovery (Ch 19-20):
- Community pulls her back
- She realizes it's not about being magical, it's about connection
- Self-worth: 2 → 5 (starts healing)
```
