## Validation Rules for Catalysts

1. **Magnitude Match**: Event magnitude must match jump size
   - 3-point jump: Significant event
   - 4-point jump: Life-changing event
   - 5-point jump: Everything changes event

2. **Setup Requirement**: Major catalysts need groundwork
   - Foreshadowing
   - Building pressure
   - Character positioned for change

3. **Consequences**: Major jumps have ripple effects
   - Other dimensions affected
   - Character behavior changes
   - Story trajectory alters

4. **No Takebacks**: Major catalysts are irreversible
   - Can't un-know information
   - Can't un-break trust completely
   - Can't un-experience trauma

5. **Character Consistency**: Catalyst must fit character
   - Would this character do/say this?
   - Is this reaction authentic?
   - Does change align with growth arc?

## Using Catalysts Effectively

### Setup
- Plant seeds early
- Build pressure gradually
- Create anticipation
- Make inevitable feel surprising

### Execution
- Milk the moment
- Show through action not just dialogue
- Hit multiple senses
- Let emotion drive scene

### Aftermath
- Show immediate impact
- Track ripple effects
- Don't rush past consequences
- Let new configuration settle

### Common Mistakes
- Catalyst from nowhere (deus ex machina)
- Insufficient magnitude for jump
- Character acts out of character
- Consequences ignored
- Too many catalysts at once
- Reverting without equal catalyst

## Catalyst Chains

Some stories require sequential catalysts:

### Trust Building Chain
1. Small risk taken (+1)
2. Risk rewarded (+1)
3. Bigger risk taken (+2)
4. Major test passed (+3)

### Betrayal Recovery Chain
1. Betrayal discovered (-5)
2. Space given (-2 proximity)
3. Explanation attempted (+1 info)
4. Proof provided (+2 trust)
5. Forgiveness earned (+2 trust, +3 intimacy)

### Power Equalization Chain
1. Powerful party shows vulnerability
2. Weaker party claims agency
3. Mutual need recognized
4. Power shared by choice
5. True partnership achieved

Remember: Catalysts are the engine of story. Without them, dimensions don't move, and without movement, there's no story.
