# Positive Narrative Patterns

This document identifies **good patterns** in dimensional trajectories that create compelling stories. Use these as models when crafting your own narratives.

---

## 1. Tension Waves (Not Flatlines)

**Pattern:** Tension rises and falls in natural waves rather than staying constant.

**Why It Works:**
- Prevents reader fatigue
- Creates natural breathing room
- Makes high-tension moments more impactful by contrast
- Mirrors real emotional experience

**Indicators:**
- Tension variance > 2.0 across trajectory
- Multiple peaks and valleys
- Highest tension at climax/black moment

**Example:**
```
Beat 1: tension = 4.2
Beat 2: tension = 5.8  ↑ rising
Beat 3: tension = 6.5  ↑ peak
Beat 4: tension = 3.1  ↓ relief
Beat 5: tension = 7.2  ↑ building again
Beat 6: tension = 8.9  ↑ black moment
Beat 7: tension = 4.5  ↓ resolution
```

**How to Create:**
- Alternate scenes of conflict with scenes of connection
- Follow intense moments with reflection/processing
- Build in 3-4 major tension peaks per novel

---

## 2. Earned Climax

**Pattern:** Strong velocity spike in final third, especially around 75-85% mark.

**Why It Works:**
- Payoff feels earned after buildup
- Multiple dimensions shift simultaneously
- Reader experiences catharsis

**Indicators:**
- Velocity > 3.0 in final act
- At least 3-4 dimensions moving simultaneously
- Black moment velocity > 2x average

**Example:**
```
Average velocity (beats 1-10): 1.8
Black moment velocity (beat 12): 4.2
Resolution velocity (beat 13): 3.5
```

**How to Create:**
- Build gradually in first 70%
- Create crisis where multiple dimensions crash
- Resolution requires movement in 4+ dimensions

---

## 3. Character Growth Arc

**Pattern:** Key dimensions show clear progression from start to finish.

**Why It Works:**
- Demonstrates transformation
- Satisfies reader expectation for change
- Makes ending feel complete

**Indicators:**
- 3+ dimensions grow by ≥4 points
- Growth is gradual, not sudden jumps
- Key genre dimensions show strongest growth

**Example (Romance):**
```
              Start → End   Change
intimacy:     1 → 8         +7  ✓
trust:        3 → 7         +4  ✓
vulnerability: 1 → 8        +7  ✓
desire:       2 → 9         +7  ✓
```

**How to Create:**
- Map clear arc for 3-4 key dimensions
- Show incremental growth in each beat
- Allow setbacks but maintain overall upward trend

---

## 4. Proper Black Moment Placement

**Pattern:** Crisis/dark moment at 75-80% of story where trust/alignment crashes.

**Why It Works:**
- Follows reader expectations (trained by structure)
- Enough time to resolve without rushing
- Maximum stakes before resolution
- Tests character growth earned so far

**Indicators:**
- Trust ≤ 3 or goal_alignment ≤ 3 around beat 75-85%
- Positioned after relationship has developed
- Multiple dimensions affected (not just one)

**Example:**
```
Beat 10 (72%): trust = 6, alignment = 7, intimacy = 7
Beat 11 (78%): trust = 2, alignment = 2, intimacy = 5  ← BLACK MOMENT
Beat 12 (84%): trust = 4, alignment = 5, intimacy = 6
Beat 13 (90%): trust = 7, alignment = 8, intimacy = 8
```

**How to Create:**
- Build relationship to high point (60-70%)
- Introduce revelation/betrayal/forced choice
- Crash trust or alignment to ≤3
- Show recovery through final 20-25%

---

## 5. Multi-Layered Tension

**Pattern:** No single component drives > 60% of total tension.

**Why It Works:**
- Creates complex, rich narrative
- Prevents one-note feeling
- Engages readers on multiple levels
- Mirrors real relationship complexity

**Indicators:**
- All major components contribute 15-40%
- Primary driver changes across story
- At least 3 active tension sources

**Example:**
```
Tension Breakdown:
- vulnerability_trust_gap: 28%
- desire_proximity_gap: 25%
- stakes: 22%
- goal_misalignment: 15%
- info_asymmetry: 10%
```

**How to Create:**
- Track 4-5 dimensions actively
- Don't rely solely on stakes or danger
- Add interpersonal tension (trust, alignment, desire)
- Weave in mystery (info_asymmetry)

---

## 6. Smooth Pacing Curve

**Pattern:** Act 2 maintains or slightly exceeds Act 1 velocity; Act 3 builds but doesn't double.

**Why It Works:**
- Prevents "sagging middle"
- Avoids rushed ending
- Maintains reader engagement throughout

**Indicators:**
- Act 2 velocity ≥ 0.8 × Act 1 velocity
- Act 3 velocity ≤ 2.0 × Act 1 velocity
- No beats with velocity < 0.3 or > 5.0

**Example:**
```
Act 1 avg velocity: 1.8
Act 2 avg velocity: 2.1  (1.17x Act 1) ✓
Act 3 avg velocity: 3.2  (1.78x Act 1) ✓
```

**How to Create:**
- Plan dimensional movement for each beat
- Avoid long static stretches in middle
- Build final act intensity gradually
- Spread resolution across 2-3 beats

---

## 7. Productive Sawtooth (Build-Break-Rebuild)

**Pattern:** Dimension rises, falls, rises again - but only 1-2 times, not constantly.

**Why It Works:**
- Shows relationship tested and strengthened
- Creates setbacks that feel meaningful
- Demonstrates resilience and growth
- Prevents predictability

**Indicators:**
- 1-2 major reversals per dimension
- Each reversal larger than previous peak
- Final peak higher than all previous

**Example (Trust):**
```
Build:    3 → 4 → 5 → 6
Break:    6 → 3 (black moment)
Rebuild:  3 → 5 → 6 → 8 (higher than before)
```

**How to Create:**
- Build trust/intimacy steadily
- Create 1 major break (black moment)
- Rebuild to higher level than before
- Avoid constant oscillation (exhausting)

---

## 8. Chemistry Indicators (Romance)

**Pattern:** High desire + vulnerability + moderate info_asymmetry in first 40%.

**Why It Works:**
- Hooks reader early
- Establishes attraction and stakes
- Creates investment in relationship
- Balances known and mysterious

**Indicators:**
- Desire rises to 6+ by 40% mark
- Vulnerability present (3+) early
- Info_asymmetry 3-6 (mystery without confusion)
- Chemistry score > 4.0 in early beats

**Example:**
```
Beat 1: desire=2, vulnerability=1, info_asym=4 → chemistry=2.4
Beat 2: desire=5, vulnerability=3, info_asym=5 → chemistry=4.2 ✓
Beat 3: desire=7, vulnerability=5, info_asym=4 → chemistry=5.6 ✓
```

**How to Create:**
- Show attraction/desire early (charged moments)
- Give characters vulnerability (stakes, fears)
- Maintain some mystery (backstory, motivations)
- Don't reveal everything in first 20%

---

## 9. Catalyst-Matched Jumps

**Pattern:** Large dimensional jumps (≥3 points) occur at specific, justified moments.

**Why It Works:**
- Changes feel earned, not random
- Reader can track cause-effect
- Catalysts create memorable beats
- Prevents "teleportation" feeling

**Indicators:**
- All jumps ≥3 have matching catalyst
- Catalyst type fits dimension change
- Jumps clustered at key plot points

**Example:**
```
Beat 5: trust jumps 2→6 (+4)
Catalyst: Hero saves heroine's life, reveals vulnerability
Type: Sacrifice + vulnerability revelation
Justified: Yes ✓
```

**Common Catalysts:**
- **Trust jumps:** Sacrifice, vulnerability, keeping promises
- **Intimacy jumps:** Physical/emotional breakthrough
- **Info_asymmetry drops:** Revelation, confession
- **Stakes jumps:** New threat, raised consequences
- **Alignment jumps:** Shared goal emerges or fractures

---

## 10. Genre-Aligned Ending

**Pattern:** Final state meets genre requirements naturally.

**Why It Works:**
- Satisfies genre expectations
- Delivers on promises made to reader
- Creates emotional payoff
- Prevents "wrong genre" feeling

**Indicators:**

**Romance:**
- Intimacy ≥ 8
- Trust ≥ 7
- Goal_alignment ≥ 8
- Power_differential near 0

**Dark Romance:**
- Intimacy ≥ 7
- Trust ≥ 6
- Power_differential -2 to +2
- Danger/stakes can remain elevated

**Thriller:**
- Danger resolved (≤ 3)
- Stakes lowered (≤ 4)
- Info_asymmetry resolved (≤ 2)

**Example (Romance):**
```
Final Beat:
  intimacy: 8 ✓
  trust: 7 ✓
  goal_alignment: 9 ✓
  desire: 9
  power_differential: 0 ✓
```

---

## 11. Gradual Information Revelation

**Pattern:** Info_asymmetry decreases steadily (1-2 points per beat), not in dumps.

**Why It Works:**
- Maintains mystery without confusion
- Prevents exposition dumps
- Creates satisfying discovery process
- Keeps reader engaged

**Indicators:**
- No single drop > 3 points
- Info_asymmetry 8-10 at start
- Info_asymmetry 0-2 at end
- Steady downward trend

**Example:**
```
Beat 1:  info_asym = 9
Beat 3:  info_asym = 7  (-2)
Beat 5:  info_asym = 5  (-2)
Beat 7:  info_asym = 4  (-1)
Beat 9:  info_asym = 2  (-2)
Beat 11: info_asym = 1  (-1)
```

**How to Create:**
- Parcel out revelations
- Each scene reveals 1 key piece
- Spread backstory across chapters
- Save biggest reveal for black moment

---

## 12. Power Exchange Pattern (Dark Romance)

**Pattern:** Power_differential shifts direction at least once, showing mutual vulnerability.

**Why It Works:**
- Prevents toxic power imbalance
- Shows both characters have agency
- Creates dynamic relationship
- Demonstrates trust through power exchange

**Indicators:**
- Power starts at ±4 or ±5
- Shifts to 0 or switches direction
- At least one reversal point
- Final state -2 to +2

**Example:**
```
Beat 1:  power_diff = +5  (A has all power)
Beat 4:  power_diff = +3  (A losing some)
Beat 7:  power_diff = 0   (Equal)
Beat 9:  power_diff = -2  (B has edge)
Beat 11: power_diff = +1  (Nearly equal, A slight edge)
```

**How to Create:**
- Start with clear power imbalance
- Give lower-power character moments of leverage
- Show higher-power character vulnerability
- Move toward equality as trust builds
