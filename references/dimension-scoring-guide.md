## QUICK SCORING TIPS

1. **Use whole numbers for clarity**, decimals when truly between levels
2. **Compare to examples** - find closest match
3. **Track changes** - movement matters more than absolute values
4. **Stay consistent** - use same rubric throughout your analysis
5. **Multiple dimensions** can be at same level (that's normal)
6. **Context matters** - the same action hits different at different dimension levels

---

## COMMON SCORING MISTAKES TO AVOID

**Mistake 1: Conflating dimensions**
- Intimacy and Trust are different
- High desire doesn't mean high intimacy
- Keep each dimension distinct

**Mistake 2: Only using extremes**
- Most scenes are 3-7 range
- 0, 9, and 10 should be rare
- Nuance lives in the middle

**Mistake 3: Ignoring genre context**
- A "high stakes" romance (7) differs from thriller (9+)
- Calibrate to your genre's typical ranges

**Mistake 4: Forgetting it's relative**
- What matters is change over time
- Consistent scoring matters more than "perfect" scores
- Track trajectories, not just snapshots

**Mistake 5: Overthinking**
- Trust your instinct
- If two values feel similar, they probably are
- Imperfect scoring is fine - patterns emerge

## Example Scene Scoring

**Scene: First Kiss**

Possible configuration:
- Intimacy: 5 → 7 (jumped from friends to romantic connection)
- Trust: 6 (solid, but this is still new)
- Desire: 8 (strong attraction driving the moment)
- Vulnerability: 7 (both opened up emotionally)
- Goal Alignment: 8 (both want to be together)
- Power Differential: 0 (equal agency in the moment)
- Info Asymmetry: 3 (know each other pretty well)
- Stakes: 6 (risking the friendship)
- Proximity: 10 (in each other's arms)

**Scene: Betrayal Revealed**

Possible configuration:
- Intimacy: 7 → 4 (emotional distance after revelation)
- Trust: 8 → 1 (shattered by betrayal)
- Desire: 8 (still love them despite hurt)
- Vulnerability: 9 (emotionally raw and exposed)
- Goal Alignment: 8 → 2 (now opposing after lies)
- Power Differential: 0 → +3 (betrayed party has moral high ground)
- Info Asymmetry: 2 → 0 (secret now revealed)
- Stakes: 9 (relationship on the line)
- Proximity: 8 (probably still physically present for confrontation)
