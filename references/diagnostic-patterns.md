# Diagnostic Patterns for Story Problems

Common narrative issues diagnosed through dimensional analysis and their solutions.

## The Flat Scene Syndrome

### Symptoms
- Reader skimming
- "Nothing happens" feeling
- Scenes feel like filler

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **All dimensions static** (velocity = 0)
- No dimensional movement for 2+ scenes
- Tension below 3

### Solutions
1. **Move 2-3 dimensions**: Pick dimensions that conflict
2. **Create micro-arc**: Small rise and fall within scene
3. **Add subplot dimension**: Secondary relationship/goal
4. **Increase stakes temporarily**: Even small stakes help

### Example Fix
Before: Dinner scene, intimacy=5, trust=5, all static
After: Dinner scene where:
- Vulnerability increases +2 (shares embarrassing story)
- Trust wavers -1 then +2 (tests reaction)
- Proximity forced high (small table)

## The Unearned Moment

### Symptoms
- Reader doesn't believe development
- "Too fast" criticism
- Emotional moments fall flat

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Dimension jumps 3+ without catalyst**
- Teleportation between states
- Missing trajectory steps

### Solutions
1. **Add stepping stones**: Break jump into smaller moves
2. **Insert catalyst event**: Justify the jump
3. **Show the journey**: Make change visible
4. **Slow the velocity**: Take more scenes

### Example Fix
Before: Trust 3 → Trust 8 (one scene)
After: 
- Trust 3 → 4 (small risk rewarded)
- Trust 4 → 5 (shares minor secret)
- Trust 5 → 6 (helps without being asked)
- Trust 6 → 8 (major sacrifice witnessed)

## The Pacing Problem

### Symptoms
- "Drags in the middle"
- "Rushed ending"
- Inconsistent reading experience

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Velocity inconsistent**: Fast/slow/fast/slow
- Middle act velocity < 1
- Final act velocity > 5

### Solutions
1. **Map velocity curve**: Identify problem areas
2. **Redistribute movement**: Spread changes evenly
3. **Vary dimensions moved**: Different dims for variety
4. **Add parallel arcs**: Subplot maintains movement

### Velocity Guidelines
- Act 1: 2-3 points/chapter average
- Act 2: 1.5-2 points/chapter minimum
- Act 3: 3-4 points/chapter maximum

## The Tension Plateau

### Symptoms
- Reader fatigue
- Numbness to stakes
- Diminishing impact

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Tension constant > 7 for multiple chapters**
- No relief valleys
- Same dimensions driving tension

### Solutions
1. **Create tension waves**: High/medium/high pattern
2. **Rotate tension drivers**: Different components
3. **Moment of relief**: Brief tension drop
4. **Change tension type**: Internal vs external

### Example Pattern
- Chapter 1: Tension 8 (danger-driven)
- Chapter 2: Tension 5 (recovery/bonding)
- Chapter 3: Tension 7 (trust-driven)
- Chapter 4: Tension 4 (false security)
- Chapter 5: Tension 9 (betrayal)

## The Muddy Middle

### Symptoms
- Story loses direction
- Multiple plotlines tangle
- Reader confusion

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Too many dimensions moving**: 5+ simultaneously
- Contradictory movements
- No clear primary arc

### Solutions
1. **Identify primary arc**: 2-3 main dimensions
2. **Subordinate other movements**: Support main arc
3. **Sequential not simultaneous**: Resolve some before starting others
4. **Clear hierarchy**: Primary/secondary/tertiary

### Arc Priority Structure
- Primary: Romance arc (intimacy, trust, desire)
- Secondary: External conflict (stakes, danger)
- Tertiary: Character growth (vulnerability, power)

## The False Conflict

### Symptoms
- Conflict feels manufactured
- "Just talk to each other!"
- Misunderstanding-based drama

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Only info asymmetry creating tension**
- Other dimensions aligned
- No fundamental conflict

### Solutions
1. **Add genuine opposition**: Goal misalignment
2. **Create value conflicts**: Different worldviews
3. **External pressure**: Forces preventing resolution
4. **Internal barriers**: Character flaws blocking progress

### Real Conflict Dimensions
- Goal Alignment < 5
- Power Differential > |3|
- Trust < 4 with cause
- Stakes that oppose each other

## The Weak Black Moment

### Symptoms
- Climax lacks impact
- Reader unmoved
- Resolution feels arbitrary

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Insufficient dimensional crash**
- Not threatening core promise
- Easy reversal possible

### Solutions
1. **Crash multiple dimensions**: 3+ simultaneously
2. **Target core genre promise**: Romance=intimacy, Mystery=truth
3. **Make reversal difficult**: Require major catalyst
4. **Maximum divergence**: Dimensions at extremes

### Black Moment Formula
- Stakes → 9-10
- Trust → 0-2
- Goal Alignment → 0-2
- But Desire remains 6+ (maintains investment)
- Proximity forced high or low (not medium)

## The Limp Ending

### Symptoms
- Anticlimactic feeling
- Resolution too easy
- Genre expectations unmet

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Genre requirements not met**
- Dimensions partially resolved
- Some arcs incomplete

### Solutions
1. **Check genre constraints**: Meet all requirements
2. **Complete all arcs**: Every dimension addressed
3. **Earned resolution**: Proper catalysts for final moves
4. **Satisfying stability**: New equilibrium clear

### Ending Checklist
- [ ] Primary dimensions at genre requirements
- [ ] Secondary dimensions resolved/accepted  
- [ ] Character arcs complete
- [ ] New stable state established
- [ ] Future trajectory implied

## The Cardboard Villain

### Symptoms
- Antagonist one-dimensional
- Conflict feels shallow
- No real threat

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Antagonist has no arc**
- Single dimension defines them
- No complexity/contradiction

### Solutions
1. **Give dimensional depth**: 2-3 moving dimensions
2. **Create valid goals**: Understandable if not agreeable
3. **Show vulnerability**: At least one soft dimension
4. **Arc of their own**: They change too

### Antagonist Dimensions
- Own goal (not just opposition)
- Variable power (not always strong)
- Some alignment possibility
- Personal stakes

## The Chemistry Deficit

### Symptoms
- Romance unconvincing
- No spark between characters
- Reader doesn't ship them

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Desire without foundation**
- Intimacy without vulnerability
- No push-pull dynamic

### Solutions
1. **Build attraction layers**: Physical + emotional + intellectual
2. **Create productive tension**: Desire vs. obstacle
3. **Show private moments**: Vulnerability glimpses
4. **Unique connection**: What only they share

### Chemistry Formula
- Desire: 6+
- Proximity variance (close/far/close)
- Vulnerability: 5+ (at least momentarily)
- Some info asymmetry (mystery/discovery)
- Power balance shifts

## The Info Dump

### Symptoms
- Exposition heavy
- Reader overwhelmed
- Pacing stops dead

### Dimensional Diagnosis
- **Info asymmetry resolves too fast**
- No gradual revelation
- Single massive jump

### Solutions
1. **Graduated revelation**: Information in stages
2. **Emotional processing**: React to each reveal
3. **Active discovery**: Character earns information
4. **Interweave with action**: Reveal through events

### Information Pacing
- Setup: Asymmetry 8-10
- Early reveals: -1 point per chapter
- Middle acceleration: -2 points per chapter
- Crisis reveal: -3 to -4 points
- Resolution: Asymmetry 0-2

## Diagnostic Workflow

### Quick Scene Check
1. What dimensions moved?
2. How much did they move?
3. Was movement earned?
4. Is tension appropriate?
5. Does this advance the arc?

### Chapter Analysis
1. Map starting configuration
2. Map ending configuration
3. Calculate velocity
4. Check genre trajectory
5. Identify problems
6. Apply solutions

### Full Story Audit
1. Graph all dimensional arcs
2. Mark catalyst events
3. Calculate tension curve
4. Check genre requirements
5. Identify flat spots
6. Verify character growth
7. Validate ending

## Common Pattern Combinations

### "Boring But Tense"
- High stakes but no movement
- Solution: Move other dimensions

### "Busy But Flat"
- Lots happening, no tension
- Solution: Focus on fewer, conflicting dimensions

### "Fast But Unearned"
- Rapid movement, no catalysts
- Solution: Add events that justify changes

### "Stuck in Loop"
- Dimensions oscillate without progress
- Solution: Break pattern with new catalyst

### "All External"
- Only stakes/danger creating tension
- Solution: Add internal dimension movement

## Prevention Strategies

### During Planning
- Map intended trajectory
- Mark catalyst events
- Check genre requirements
- Plan tension waves

### During Writing
- Track configuration per scene
- Monitor velocity
- Verify catalyst presence
- Maintain variety

### During Revision
- Graph actual trajectory
- Compare to plan
- Identify flat spots
- Add missing catalysts
- Smooth velocity curves
- Verify genre compliance

Remember: Diagnosis is just the first step. The dimensional model shows you WHERE the problem is and suggests HOW to fix it, but the creative solution—the specific events and moments—that's where your storytelling craft shines.
