# Thriller Quick Reference

## Ending Requirements

| Type | Danger | Stakes | Trust | Info Asymmetry | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|----------------|-------|
| **Psychological** | varies | high | variable | resolved | Reality ambiguity maintained |
| **Action** | ≥7 sustained | ≥8 sustained | earned | resolved | Proximity varies wildly |

**Ending Must**: Danger resolved (≤3) OR accepted (acceptance ≥8)

## Typical Arc Pattern (Action Thriller)

| Progress | Focus | What Happens |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **0-10%** | Normal World | Low stakes (1-3), low danger (0-2) |
| **10-25%** | Inciting Incident | Stakes/danger spike to 6+, point of no return |
| **25-50%** | Rising Danger | Danger escalates in discrete jumps, trust building |
| **50-65%** | False Victory | Temporary safety, tension drops briefly |
| **65-80%** | Reversal | Trust betrayed OR danger spikes to 8+ |
| **80-95%** | Dark Night | Maximum danger (9-10), all dimensions peak |
| **95-100%** | Resolution | Danger resolved or accepted |

## Key Beats Checklist

☐ **Normal World** - Establish baseline (danger 0-2, stakes 1-3)
☐ **Inciting Incident** - Stakes/danger spike (+4-5 points)
☐ **Point of No Return** - Stakes lock high (≥7)
☐ **Escalating Threats** - Danger increases in steps, not constant
☐ **False Victory (50-65%)** - Brief safety illusion
☐ **Reversal** - Trust betrayed or new threat
☐ **Dark Night** - Maximum danger (9-10)
☐ **Final Battle** - All dimensions at extremes
☐ **Resolution** - Danger eliminated or acceptance achieved

## Common Pitfalls

- **Plateau Danger**: Constant high stakes = reader numbness
- **Trust Whiplash**: Unrealistic trust fluctuations without catalyst
- **Convenient Proximity**: Forcing closeness without reason
- **Static Middle**: Danger stays at same level 40-60%
- **Info Withholding**: Artificial info asymmetry maintenance
- **Weak Stakes**: Personal not visceral consequences

## Tension Formula Weights

**Psychological Thriller**:
```
TENSION = 0.20(stakes) + 0.25(info_asymmetry) +
          0.15(goal_misalignment) + 0.10(vulnerability_trust_gap) +
          0.15(power_differential) + 0.15(danger)
```
**Primary Driver**: Info asymmetry

**Action Thriller**:
```
TENSION = 0.30(stakes) + 0.10(info_asymmetry) +
          0.10(goal_misalignment) + 0.10(power_differential) +
          0.30(danger) + 0.10(proximity)
```
**Primary Drivers**: Stakes, Danger

**Target Range**: 5-7 (sustained), 8-10 (climax scenes)

## Quick Diagnostic

**If reader feels numb:**
- Check: Danger/stakes constant for 3+ chapters?
- Fix: Create tension waves - high/medium/high pattern

**If pacing drags:**
- Check: Velocity on ANY dimension ≥2?
- Fix: Never static for >1 chapter

**If trust feels fake:**
- Check: Built through action or just dialogue?
- Fix: Trust earned through shared danger

**If threat feels weak:**
- Check: Stakes personal and visceral?
- Fix: Make danger impact loved ones, not abstract

## Pacing Guidelines

- **Maintain velocity ≥2** on some dimension always
- **Never static** for more than 1 chapter
- **Danger spikes** create urgency (not constant high)
- **Tension waves**: High (8) → Relief (4) → Higher (9)

## Essential Catalysts

**For +4 Stakes**: Life threat, loved ones threatened, ticking clock, no escape
**For +5 Danger**: Immediate lethal threat, survival uncertain
**For -5 Trust**: Ally revealed as enemy, betrayal using shared knowledge
**For +3 Trust**: Sacrifice made, protection when helpless, chose wellbeing over gain

## Psychological Thriller Specifics

- **Info asymmetry** drives plot (both character AND reader)
- **Trust** wildly fluctuates with revelations
- **Stakes** compound rather than linear growth
- **Power** shifts unexpectedly
- **Reality ambiguity** maintained throughout
- **Multiple unreliable narrators** possible

**Key Dimensions**: Info asymmetry, trust, moral ambiguity, power

## Action Thriller Specifics

- **Danger ≥7** sustained through middle and end
- **Stakes ≥8** sustained once established
- **Proximity** varies wildly (forced together/apart)
- **Trust** builds through shared danger
- **Physical action** drives dimensional changes
- **External threats** primary driver

**Key Dimensions**: Danger, stakes, proximity

## Tension Wave Pattern (Example)

- **Chapter 1**: Tension 8 (danger spike)
- **Chapter 2**: Tension 5 (recovery/planning)
- **Chapter 3**: Tension 7 (trust-driven conflict)
- **Chapter 4**: Tension 4 (false security)
- **Chapter 5**: Tension 9 (betrayal or major danger)
- **Chapter 6**: Tension 6 (regrouping)
- **Climax**: Tension 10

**Goal**: Vary tension TYPE not just level - danger, trust, info, stakes rotation

## Beat Mapping

1. **Normal**: Low all dimensions
2. **Inciting Incident**: Stakes/danger spike
3. **Point of No Return**: Stakes lock high
4. **Rising**: Escalating threats
5. **False Victory**: Temporary safety
6. **Reversal**: Trust betrayed
7. **Dark Night**: Maximum danger
8. **Final Battle**: All dimensions peak
9. **Resolution**: Danger resolved/accepted
