## Scoring Tips

### General Guidelines
- **Use whole numbers** for clarity (decimals when truly between)
- **5 is neutral** midpoint for most dimensions
- **Most scenes**: 3-7 range (extremes are rare)
- **0, 9, 10**: Reserve for exceptional moments
- **Consistency matters** more than perfection
- **Track change** over time, not just snapshots

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Only using extremes (0, 5, 10)
- ❌ Conflating intimacy and trust
- ❌ Forgetting genre context (stakes 7 in romance ≠ stakes 7 in thriller)
- ❌ Making all dimensions move at once
- ❌ Ignoring catalysts for big jumps (3+ points)

## Common Dimension Combinations

### Romance Patterns
| Combination | Effect | Example Scene |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| High desire + Low trust | **Dangerous attraction** | Enemies attracted despite suspicion |
| High intimacy + Low proximity | **Yearning** | Long-distance or forced apart |
| High vulnerability + Low trust | **Risk/tension** | Opening up to someone unproven |
| High desire + High proximity | **Chemistry** | Forced together, attraction high |
| Low intimacy + High proximity | **Awkward/tense** | Trapped with stranger |

### Thriller Patterns
| Combination | Effect | Example Scene |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| High stakes + High danger | **Peak tension** | Life-or-death crisis |
| High danger + Low trust | **Paranoia** | Can't trust allies |
| High info asymmetry + High stakes | **Suspense** | Hidden threat, high consequences |
| Low danger + High stakes | **Psychological** | No physical threat but much at risk |

### Mystery Patterns
| Combination | Effect | Example Scene |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| High info asymmetry + Low stakes | **Puzzle** | Classic whodunit |
| High info asymmetry + Fluctuating trust | **Investigation** | Sussing out suspects |
| Decreasing info asymmetry + Rising stakes | **Race to solve** | Danger increases as truth nears |

## Dimensional Conflicts (Create Tension)

**Productive Conflicts**:
- Desire (8) vs Trust (3) = Dangerous attraction
- Vulnerability (7) vs Trust (4) = Risk-taking
- Desire (7) vs Proximity (2) = Yearning/longing
- Goal Alignment (2) vs Intimacy (6) = Torn loyalty
- Power Diff (4) vs Intimacy (7) = Complicated dynamics

**Less Productive** (Low tension):
- All dimensions aligned and high
- All dimensions aligned and low
- No contradictions or gaps

## Catalyst Requirements

**No Catalyst Needed** (0-2 point movement):
- Natural progression
- Time passing
- Small interactions
- Minor revelations

**Catalyst Required** (3+ point jump):
- Significant event
- Life-changing moment
- Major revelation
- Extreme circumstances

**Example Catalysts**:
- **+3 Trust**: Major sacrifice, protection when helpless
- **-5 Trust**: Betrayal discovery, crucial lie revealed
- **+4 Intimacy**: Life saved, trauma shared
- **+3 Vulnerability**: Breakdown, asking for help
- **-4 Info Asymmetry**: Major revelation, secret exposed

## Scene Quick-Check Formula

1. **Where are we?** (List current scores)
2. **Where do we end?** (List ending scores)
3. **What changed?** (Calculate deltas)
4. **Why?** (Identify catalyst if Δ ≥ 3)
5. **Tension?** (Calculate using genre formula)

## Target Ranges by Genre

### Romance
- **Must be high**: Desire (6+), Intimacy (building to 8+)
- **Should fluctuate**: Trust, Vulnerability, Proximity
- **Creates tension**: Vuln-trust gap, Desire-proximity gap
- **Ending**: Intimacy ≥8, Trust ≥7, Goal Align ≥8

### Thriller
- **Must be high**: Stakes (7+), Danger (varies but spikes high)
- **Should fluctuate**: Trust, Info Asymmetry, Proximity
- **Creates tension**: Stakes + Danger combination
- **Ending**: Danger resolved (≤3) or accepted

### Mystery
- **Must be high**: Info Asymmetry (starts 8-10)
- **Should decrease**: Info Asymmetry (-1 to -2/chapter)
- **Should fluctuate**: Trust (in suspects)
- **Creates tension**: Info Asymmetry primarily
- **Ending**: Info Asymmetry ≤2

## Velocity Guidelines

**Velocity** = Points moved per chapter

| Velocity | Effect | Usage |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 0 | Static scene | Max 1 chapter, then stale |
| 0.5-1 | Slow burn | Romance slow build |
| 1-2 | Standard | Most genres, sustainable |
| 2-3 | Fast-paced | Act 1, Act 3 |
| 3-5 | Rapid | Major events, climax |
| 5+ | Too fast | Unearned unless catalyst |

**Goal**: Average 1.5-2 points/chapter on 2-3 dimensions

## Dimension Priority by Genre

**Romance**: Intimacy, Trust, Desire, Vulnerability (primary)
**Dark Romance**: Add Power Differential, Stakes, Danger
**Thriller**: Stakes, Danger, Info Asymmetry, Trust
**Mystery**: Info Asymmetry (dominant), Trust, Stakes
**Fantasy**: Add World Complexity, Power (magical)

## Quick Reference Formulas

**Goal Misalignment** = 10 - Goal Alignment
**Vuln-Trust Gap** = max(0, Vulnerability - Trust)
**Desire-Prox Gap** = max(0, Desire - Proximity)
**Power Diff (for tension)** = abs(Power Differential)

## When to Use Each Dimension

**Always Track** (Universal):
- Intimacy
- Trust
- Goal Alignment
- Stakes

**Romance Specific**:
- Desire
- Vulnerability
- Proximity
- Power Differential

**Thriller Specific**:
- Danger
- Info Asymmetry
- Stakes (higher weight)

**Mystery Specific**:
- Info Asymmetry (primary)
- Mystery (reader knowledge)

**Dark/Morally Complex**:
- Moral Ambiguity
- Power Differential
- Danger

## Pro Tips for Practical Use

1. **Start simple**: Track 4-5 dimensions first
2. **Add as needed**: Genre-specific dimensions when relevant
3. **Focus on change**: Movement matters more than absolute values
4. **Use templates**: Start with genre patterns, customize
5. **Visual tracking**: Graph arcs to spot flatlines
6. **Regular check-ins**: Score every scene or chapter
7. **Compare to genre**: Use genre configs for targets
8. **Trust instinct**: If it feels right, it probably is
