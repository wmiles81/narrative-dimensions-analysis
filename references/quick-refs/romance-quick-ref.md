# Romance Quick Reference

## Ending Requirements

| Type | Intimacy | Trust | Goal Align | Power Diff | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Contemporary** | ≥8 | ≥7 | ≥8 | -1 to +1 | Balanced partnership |
| **Dark** | ≥7 | ≥6 | flexible | -2 to +2 | Stakes stay ≥5 |
| **Enemies to Lovers** | ≥8 | ≥7 | ≥8 | near 0 | Goal alignment slowest |
| **Serial Killer** | ≥6 | ≥5 | flexible | varies | Info asymmetry ≤3, moral ambiguity ≥7 |

## Typical Arc Pattern (Contemporary)

| Progress | Focus | What Happens |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **0-25%** | Meeting & Attraction | Desire spikes, intimacy low, info asymmetry high |
| **25-50%** | Connection Building | Intimacy climbs +2-3, trust sawtooth pattern begins |
| **50-75%** | Deepening | Vulnerability increases, false victory at 50% |
| **75-90%** | Black Moment | Trust crashes, goals misalign, but desire stays ≥6 |
| **90-100%** | Resolution | All dimensions align, vulnerability maxed (9-10) |

## Key Beats Checklist

☐ **First Connection (25%)** - Intimacy jumps 2+ points
☐ **False Victory (50%)** - Trust peaks temporarily
☐ **Black Moment (75%)** - Trust crashes, goals misalign
☐ **Grand Gesture (90%)** - Vulnerability maximum (9-10)
☐ **HEA/HFN** - All ending requirements met

## Common Pitfalls

- **Unearned HEA**: Jumping to ending coordinates without journey
- **Artificial 3rd Act Breakup**: Trust crash at 80% without catalyst
- **Cardboard Conflict**: Only one dimension creating tension
- **Info Dump**: Too much revelation too fast
- **Static Middle**: No dimensional movement 50-70%
- **Misaligned Velocity**: Intimacy races ahead of trust

## Tension Formula Weights (Contemporary)

```
TENSION = 0.15(stakes) + 0.10(info_asymmetry) +
          0.15(goal_misalignment) + 0.25(vulnerability_trust_gap) +
          0.25(desire_proximity_gap) + 0.10(power_differential)
```

**Primary Drivers**: Vulnerability-trust gap, Desire-proximity gap
**Target Range**: 4-7 (steady engagement), 8-9 (peak scenes only)

## Quick Diagnostic

**If scene feels flat:**
- Check: All dimensions static?
- Fix: Move 2-3 dimensions even slightly

**If chemistry is weak:**
- Check: Desire, vulnerability, proximity scores
- Fix: High desire (6+) + vulnerability moments (5+) + varying proximity

**If conflict feels fake:**
- Check: Only info asymmetry driving tension?
- Fix: Add goal misalignment or power imbalance

**If ending unsatisfying:**
- Check: All ending requirements met?
- Fix: Verify intimacy ≥8, trust ≥7, goal alignment ≥8

## Pacing Guidelines

- **Slow Burn**: Intimacy velocity ≤0.5/chapter
- **Standard**: 1-1.5 points/chapter on 2-3 dimensions
- **Insta-Love**: Intimacy velocity ≥2/chapter, trust lags behind

## Essential Catalysts

**For +3 Intimacy Jump**: Saving life, shared trauma, first "I love you"
**For -5 Trust Crash**: Betrayal discovery, broken crucial promise
**For +3 Vulnerability**: Breakdown, asking for help, sharing trauma
**For Desire Spike**: First kiss, near-loss, seeing them heroic/vulnerable

## Dark Romance Differences

- Power differential oscillates (-2 to +2)
- Stakes NEVER drop below 6
- Danger baseline 4+
- Trust builds through action not words
- Vulnerability forced before chosen
- Moral ambiguity dimension matters (≥7)

## Enemies to Lovers Specifics

- Goal alignment slowest dimension (starts 0-2, ends ≥8)
- Respect builds before affection
- Desire high despite low trust
- Power differential neutralizes gradually

**Phases**:
1. Active Opposition (goals opposed)
2. Reluctant Alliance (temporary goal alignment)
3. Respect Emergence (see beyond surface)
4. Wall Dissolution (vulnerability increases)
5. True Partnership (goals merge)
