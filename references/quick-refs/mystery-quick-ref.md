# Mystery Quick Reference

## Ending Requirements

| Type | Info Asymmetry | Stakes | Trust | Danger | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Cozy** | ≤2 | 3-6 | varies | ≤3 | Community trust important |
| **Noir** | ≤2 | moderate | ≤4 | varies | No clean resolutions, moral ambiguity |

**Ending Must**: Information revealed (info asymmetry ≤2), mystery solved

## Typical Arc Pattern (Cozy Mystery)

| Progress | Focus | What Happens |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **0-10%** | Setup | Normal world, info asymmetry = 0 |
| **10-15%** | Inciting Incident | Crime occurs, info asymmetry jumps to 8-10 |
| **15-50%** | Investigation | Info asymmetry reduces stepwise (-1 to -2/chapter) |
| **50-65%** | Red Herrings | Info asymmetry fluctuates (false leads) |
| **65-85%** | Pattern Recognition | Info asymmetry drops faster (-2 to -3/chapter) |
| **85-95%** | Confrontation | Final reveals, info asymmetry → 0-2 |
| **95-100%** | Resolution | All questions answered, community restored |

## Key Beats Checklist

☐ **Crime Occurs** - Info asymmetry jumps to 8-10
☐ **First Clues** - Info asymmetry begins decreasing
☐ **Red Herrings (30-60%)** - Trust in suspects fluctuates
☐ **False Lead** - Temporary info asymmetry increase
☐ **Pattern Emerges** - Info asymmetry accelerates down
☐ **Key Revelation (75%)** - Major info asymmetry drop (-3 to -4)
☐ **Confrontation** - Final secrets revealed
☐ **Resolution** - Info asymmetry ≤2, all explained

## Common Pitfalls

- **Info Dump**: Asymmetry resolves too quickly (single scene)
- **Withholding**: Artificial maintenance of info asymmetry
- **Unsatisfying Reveal**: New information at resolution (unfair)
- **No Stakes**: Investigation feels academic
- **Too Complex**: Too many suspects/clues to track
- **Red Herring Overload**: Reader gives up trying to solve

## Tension Formula Weights

**Cozy Mystery**:
```
TENSION = 0.10(stakes) + 0.40(info_asymmetry) +
          0.15(goal_misalignment) + 0.15(trust) +
          0.20(mystery)
```
**Primary Driver**: Info asymmetry (40%)

**Noir Mystery**:
```
TENSION = 0.20(stakes) + 0.25(info_asymmetry) +
          0.15(goal_misalignment) + 0.10(trust) +
          0.15(power_differential) + 0.15(moral_ambiguity)
```
**Primary Drivers**: Info asymmetry, Stakes

**Target Range**: 3-5 (cozy), 5-7 (noir)

## Quick Diagnostic

**If reader confused:**
- Check: Too many suspects/clues at once?
- Fix: Introduce clues sequentially, max 3-4 active suspects

**If solution feels unfair:**
- Check: Reader had access to all clues?
- Fix: No new information at reveal, plant all clues by 75%

**If investigation drags:**
- Check: Info asymmetry velocity too slow?
- Fix: -1 to -2 points per chapter minimum

**If stakes feel weak:**
- Check: Personal connection to crime?
- Fix: Make victim/crime impact protagonist directly

## Pacing Guidelines (Info Asymmetry)

- **Setup**: Info asymmetry 8-10 (mystery established)
- **Early Investigation**: -1 point/chapter (15-30%)
- **Middle Investigation**: -2 points/chapter (30-65%)
- **Acceleration**: -2 to -3 points/chapter (65-85%)
- **Crisis Reveal**: -3 to -4 points in single scene (85-90%)
- **Resolution**: Info asymmetry 0-2

## Essential Catalysts

**For -3 Info Jump**: Key evidence discovered, witness comes forward, alibi shattered
**For -4 Info Jump**: Hidden connection revealed, pattern recognized, full confession
**For +2 Info Jump**: Red herring, false lead, misdirection
**For Trust Crash**: Suspect caught in lie, trusted ally suspicious

## Red Herring Management

**Purpose**: Create info asymmetry fluctuation, maintain engagement
**Pattern**:
1. False lead discovered (+2 info asymmetry in wrong direction)
2. Investigation follows false trail (1-2 chapters)
3. Lead disproven (-2 info asymmetry)
4. Back to baseline, actual progress made

**Max**: 2-3 significant red herrings per book
**Timing**: Primarily in 30-60% range

## Information Pacing Example

| Chapter | Event | Info Asymmetry | Change |
|---------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Crime occurs | 10 | +10 |
| 2-3 | First clues | 8 | -2 |
| 4-6 | Investigation | 6 | -2 |
| 7 | Red herring | 7 | +1 |
| 8-9 | Back on track | 5 | -2 |
| 10-11 | Pattern emerges | 3 | -2 |
| 12 | Key revelation | 1 | -2 |
| 13 | Confrontation | 0 | -1 |

## Cozy Mystery Specifics

- **Stakes**: Moderate (3-6), personal not global
- **Danger**: Low (≤3), minimal violence
- **Community**: Trust in community matters
- **Tone**: Info asymmetry drives tension, not fear
- **Resolution**: Complete and satisfying
- **Trust**: Fluctuates with suspects

**Key Dimensions**: Info asymmetry (primary), trust, stakes

## Noir Mystery Specifics

- **Trust**: Uniformly low (≤4), everyone suspect
- **Moral Ambiguity**: High (≥7), no clean hands
- **Stakes**: Higher than cozy, often personal cost
- **Info Cost**: Information comes at price
- **Resolution**: Partial or pyrrhic
- **Cynicism**: Increases through investigation
- **Power**: Differential matters (corruption)

**Key Dimensions**: Info asymmetry, moral ambiguity, trust, power

## Clue Distribution Strategy

**Fair Play Rules**:
- All clues available to reader by 75%
- No withheld information that protagonist knows
- Red herrings must have logical explanation
- Solution must follow from clues shown

**Distribution**:
- **15-30%**: Establish facts, initial clues (3-4)
- **30-50%**: More clues, red herrings (5-7 total clues)
- **50-75%**: Final clues planted (all clues now available)
- **75-85%**: Pattern recognition phase
- **85-100%**: Revelation and confirmation

## Suspect Management

**Number**: 3-5 viable suspects maximum
**Differentiation**: Each has unique motive/opportunity/means
**Trust Tracking**: Track protagonist's trust in each separately
**Elimination**: Remove suspects sequentially as alibis confirm
**Misdirection**: Most suspicious often innocent

## Trust Fluctuation Pattern

- **Initial**: Neutral trust in community (5-6)
- **Crime**: General trust drops (4)
- **Suspects**: Individual trust varies (2-7 range)
- **Red Herrings**: Trust spikes and crashes
- **Resolution**: Trust restored in innocent, confirmed broken in guilty

## Tension Through Investigation

**Vary Tension Type**:
- Info asymmetry (primary)
- Trust (in suspects)
- Stakes (personal risk)
- Time pressure (optional)

**Avoid**: Pure info asymmetry tension - gets tedious
**Add**: Personal stakes, relationship dynamics, subplots
