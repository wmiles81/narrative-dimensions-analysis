# Fantasy Genre Guide

Dimensional analysis for fantasy narratives.

## Core Fantasy Requirements

### Ending Requirements

**Character Arc (mandatory):**
- **Power:** Significant growth (minimum +2-3 points on power scale)
- **Stakes:** Resolution (threat addressed, ≤ 4 OR acceptance ≥ 8)
- **Trust:** Tested and proven through trials
- **Goal Alignment:** Often shifts from personal to larger cause

**Throughout:**
- **Stakes ≥ 9** for epic fantasy (global/world-ending)
- **Stakes 6-8** for personal fantasy (character-focused)
- **World Complexity:** Tracked as setting dimension
- **Power Growth:** Visible trajectory

**Genre Flexibility:**
Fantasy is diverse - requirements vary significantly by subgenre. The dimensional approach adapts to each type.

## Universal Fantasy Elements

### Magic as Dimensional Amplifier

Magic doesn't get its own dimension - it **affects existing dimensions**:

**Examples:**
- **Emotional magic:** Vulnerability directly affects power
- **Bond magic:** Intimacy grants abilities
- **Truth magic:** Info asymmetry has magical consequences
- **Power magic:** Standard progression

**Key Insight:** Magic makes dimensional changes more dramatic and visible.

### The Power Dimension in Fantasy

In fantasy, **power_differential** often tracks:
- Magical ability
- Political authority
- Physical capability
- Knowledge/wisdom

**Tracking protagonist power growth:**
```
Beginning: power=-3 (weak, hunted, inexperienced)
Mid: power=-1 (learning, growing)
End: power=+2 (competent, can face the threat)
```

**Or against THE ultimate antagonist:**
```
Beginning: power_diff=-5 (utterly outmatched by dark lord)
Mid: power_diff=-3 (growing stronger, learning)
End: power_diff=0 to +1 (can challenge the threat)
```

---

## Key Fantasy Beats

### The Ordinary World (0-10%)
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
power: low or -3 (protagonist weak/young/untrained)
stakes: 1-3 (personal, small scale)
world_complexity: establishing
danger: low (safe starting point)
```

**Purpose:** Establish baseline before upheaval

---

### The Call / Inciting Incident (10-15%)
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
stakes: 2 → 6-7 (escalates rapidly)
info_asymmetry: increases (mystery introduced)
power: still low (creates tension)
goal: shifts (new mission)
```

**Examples:** Village attacked, prophecy revealed, mentor appears, power manifests

---

### Training / Journey Begins (15-40%)
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
power: -3 → -1 (gradual growth)
trust: building (with mentor/companions)
world_complexity: expanding
stakes: climbing toward global
goal_alignment: forming party/alliance
```

**Dimensional Growth:**
- Power increases steadily (not in leaps until catalyst)
- Trust built through trials
- World revealed progressively
- Stakes personal → regional → global

---

### Trials / Escalation (40-65%)
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
power: growing through challenges
stakes: 7-9 (threat clearer, more urgent)
trust: tested and proven
danger: increasing
goal_alignment: solidified (party united)
```

**Pattern:** Each trial earns power growth (catalyst events)

---

### Major Setback / Dark Night (65-75%)
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
power: may decrease (loss, betrayal, failure)
stakes: 9-10 (everything at risk)
trust: often betrayed (one dimension)
goal_alignment: shattered or questioned
vulnerability: high (emotionally raw)
```

**Fantasy's "Black Moment":** Often involves:
- Mentor death
- Betrayal
- Power loss
- Overwhelming defeat

---

### Rally / Final Preparation (75-85%)
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
power: recovery and final growth
trust: rebuilt or resolved
goal_alignment: reformed with clarity
stakes: 10 (final confrontation coming)
```

---

### Climax / Final Battle (85-95%)
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
power: peak (earned through journey)
stakes: 10 (everything on the line)
danger: 10 (maximum threat)
trust: proven (companions reliable)
goal_alignment: 10 (united purpose)
```

**All dimensions peak**

---

### Resolution / New World (95-100%)
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
power: stabilized at new higher level
stakes: resolved (≤ 4) or accepted
trust: proven and deep
world: changed by events
goal: achieved or transformed
```

## Subgenre Variations

### Epic Fantasy

**Requirements:**
- **Stakes global (≥ 9)** - World/realm/reality at risk
- **World Complexity high** - Extensive worldbuilding
- **Power differential significant** - Large power gap to overcome
- **Character growth across all dimensions** - Full journey

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Power grows from -4 to +1 or higher
- Stakes revealed progressively (personal → regional → global)
- Trust builds through trials (fellowship dynamic)
- Goal alignment shifts (personal quest → save world)

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Start: power=-4, stakes=3, trust=2, goal_align=personal
Mid: power=-1, stakes=8, trust=6, goal_align=7 (party formed)
End: power=+1, stakes=10 then 3, trust=9, goal_align=9 (fellowship proven)
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Ensemble cast (multiple trust relationships)
- Long journey (physical and emotional)
- Power growth through trials, not time
- Stakes escalate throughout

**Pacing:**
- Slow burn power growth
- Steady stakes escalation
- Multiple arcs (subplots for party members)
- Epic scope requires multiple books/long form

**Common Mistakes:**
- Power growth too fast (unearned)
- Stakes start too high (nowhere to escalate)
- Trust never tested (flat fellowship)
- World complexity overwhelming (info dump)

---

### Romantic Fantasy (Romantasy)

**Requirements:**
- **Magic affects relationship dimensions**
- **Must satisfy romance ending:** intimacy ≥ 8, trust ≥ 7
- **Must resolve fantasy stakes** (external plot)
- **Power includes magical AND emotional**

**Unique Dynamics:**
- Magic amplifies emotional states
- Destiny/fate as dimension (inevitability tension)
- Power balanced differently (one has magical power, other has emotional power)
- Trust includes accepting magical nature

**Trajectory Pattern:**
```
Intimacy: climbs as in romance
Trust: complicated by magic/secrets
Power: often imbalanced (human + magical being)
Stakes: both personal (romance) and world (fantasy)
Desire: amplified by magic
```

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Start: intimacy=2, trust=3, power_diff=+4 (fae prince + human), stakes=8, desire=5
Mid: intimacy=6, trust=5, power_diff=+2 (human gaining power), stakes=9, desire=8
End: intimacy=9, trust=8, power_diff=0 (equal partnership), stakes=3, desire=10
```

**Critical Balance:**
- Romance arc cannot overshadow fantasy plot
- Fantasy plot must service romance (not separate)
- Both arcs resolve, each affecting the other

**Common Mistakes:**
- Making romance completely separate from fantasy plot
- Power imbalance never addressed (unhealthy dynamic)
- Magic as deus ex machina for relationship problems
- Ignoring one arc's requirements

---

### Urban Fantasy

**Requirements:**
- **Modern world + magic** (world complexity from hidden magic)
- **Stakes:** Usually 6-9 (city/region, not always world)
- **Power:** Secret/hidden (info asymmetry about magic)
- **Danger:** Often sustained (supernatural threats)

**Unique Dimension:**
- **Secret keeping:** Info asymmetry about magic to mundane world
- **Dual identity:** Living in both worlds
- **Modern stakes:** Job, family, normalcy at risk

**Dimensional Example:**
```
power: moderate (has magic but limited)
info_asymmetry: 8 (hiding magic from mundanes)
stakes: 7 (city in danger, but also job/relationships)
danger: 6 (supernatural threats)
proximity: modern density (forced closeness)
```

**Pacing:**
- Faster than epic (modern pace)
- Stakes cycle (resolve and new threat)
- Series format (ongoing character)

---

### Dark Fantasy

**Requirements:**
- **Moral Ambiguity ≥ 7** throughout
- **Stakes high** but outcomes may be pyrrhic
- **Danger sustained** (≥ 6)
- **Trust problematic** (everyone compromised)
- **Acceptance** may replace resolution (living with darkness)

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Power growth through morally gray choices
- Trust limited or broken
- Stakes high but "victory" costly
- Moral ambiguity increases, not decreases

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Start: power=-2, moral_ambiguity=5, trust=5, stakes=8
Mid: power=+1, moral_ambiguity=8, trust=3, stakes=9
End: power=+2, moral_ambiguity=9, trust=4, stakes=6, acceptance=8
```

**Key Difference from Epic:**
- No clean victories
- Power gained through compromise
- Trust never fully restored
- World darker at end (or unchanged)

---

### Progression Fantasy (LitRPG/Cultivation)

**Requirements:**
- **Power growth central** (measurable, systematic)
- **Clear progression system** (levels, ranks, cultivation stages)
- **Stakes escalate with power** (more power = bigger threats)
- **Achievement-focused**

**Power as Primary Dimension:**
- Tracked precisely (Level 1 → Level 50)
- Growth through specific actions
- Plateaus and breakthroughs
- Power gaps create tension

**Dimensional Pattern:**
```
Arc 1: power=Novice, stakes=local, enemies=weak cultivators
Arc 2: power=Adept, stakes=regional, enemies=established powers
Arc 3: power=Master, stakes=national, enemies=ancient masters
Arc 4: power=Transcendent, stakes=world, enemies=gods
```

**Pacing:**
- Rapid early power growth (early levels)
- Slowing at higher tiers (plateau)
- Breakthrough moments (catalyst events)
- Continuous escalation

**Common Mistakes:**
- Only tracking power (flat character)
- Linear growth (no setbacks or plateaus)
- Stakes don't scale with power
- No cost to power gains

---

## Fantasy-Specific Dimensional Considerations

### World Complexity as Dimension

**World Complexity (0-10):** How intricate is the setting?

- **0-3:** Simple (one magic system, straightforward politics)
- **4-6:** Moderate (multiple cultures, developed magic)
- **7-9:** Complex (deep history, intricate systems, multiple storylines)
- **10:** Extremely complex (Malazan-level)

**Pacing:**
- Reveal progressively (don't dump at start)
- Complexity velocity: +1-2 points per book/major section
- Too fast = overwhelmed readers
- Too slow = boring world

---

### Destiny/Fate as Dimension

**Fate (0-10):** How much is predetermined?

- **0:** Total free will, no prophecy
- **5:** Prophecy exists but interpretation flexible
- **10:** Everything predetermined, no choice

**Creates tension through:**
- Fighting fate (low acceptance, high fate)
- Fulfilling fate (growing acceptance)
- Subverting fate (agency vs destiny)

**Dimensional Interaction:**
```
fate: 8 (prophecy says will defeat dark lord)
acceptance: 2 (refuses destiny)
power: -3 (not ready)
= Tension from gap between fate and readiness
```

---

### Magic System Effects on Dimensions

**Hard Magic (defined rules):**
- Power growth predictable
- Stakes clear (know what magic can/can't do)
- Problem-solving through magic logic

**Soft Magic (mysterious):**
- Info asymmetry about magic itself
- Power unpredictable
- Emotional/thematic more than mechanical

**Both valid - choose based on story needs**

---

## Common Fantasy Pitfalls

### Unearned Power Growth
**Problem:** Power increases without catalyst

**Dimensional Diagnosis:**
```
Chapter 5: power=-3 (weak apprentice)
Chapter 6: power=+2 (suddenly powerful)
```

**Why It Fails:** No journey, no struggle

**Solution:** Earn each power increase
- Training montage (time passage)
- Trial overcome (catalyst event)
- Sacrifice made (cost)
- Breakthrough (after struggle)

**Proper progression:**
```
Ch 5: power=-3, faces challenge, fails
Ch 7: power=-2.5, trains, small success
Ch 10: power=-2, another challenge, partial success
Ch 12: power=-1, major trial (catalyst), breakthrough
Ch 15: power=0, consolidated gains
```

---

### Stakes Inflation
**Problem:** Starting at world-ending, nowhere to escalate

**Example:**
```
Chapter 1: stakes=10 (dark lord will destroy world)
Chapter 20: stakes=still 10 (how to raise?)
```

**Solution:** Start personal, escalate
```
Chapter 1: stakes=4 (save village)
Chapter 10: stakes=7 (save region)
Chapter 20: stakes=9 (save kingdom)
Chapter 30: stakes=10 (save world)
```

---

### Static Fellowship
**Problem:** Trust in companions never tested

**Dimensional Flatness:**
```
Party formed Chapter 5: trust=6 in all members
Chapter 30: trust=still 6 (unchanged)
```

**Solution:** Test trust
- Betrayal (real or suspected)
- Competing goals
- Moral disagreements
- Sacrifice required

**Dynamic fellowship:**
```
Ch 5: trust=4 (newly formed)
Ch 10: trust=6 (proven in battle)
Ch 15: trust=2 (betrayal suspected)
Ch 20: trust=9 (proven through sacrifice)
```

---

### World Complexity Dump
**Problem:** Too much worldbuilding at once

**Info overload:**
```
Chapter 1: 20 pages of history, magic systems, politics
Reader: info_complexity overwhelm, glazing over
```

**Solution:** Reveal progressively
- Chapter 1: Basic magic + immediate culture
- Chapter 5: Add political layer
- Chapter 10: Historical context
- Chapter 15: Deep magic theory
- Chapter 20: Ancient secrets

---

## Tension Engineering for Fantasy

### High Epic Tension
```
power_differential: -5  (facing overwhelming foe)
stakes: 10              (world ending)
trust: 8                (fellowship strong)
info_asymmetry: 6       (don't know how to win)
goal_alignment: 10      (united)
vulnerability: 7        (emotionally invested)
```

**Result:** United against impossible odds

---

### Romantasy High Tension
```
desire: 9               (intense attraction)
proximity: 4            (forced apart by duty/magic)
trust: 4                (hiding magical nature)
power_differential: +4  (fae + human)
stakes: 9               (world + relationship)
intimacy: 6             (growing but limited)
```

**Result:** Romance complicated by fantasy elements

---

## Pacing Guidelines

### Epic Fantasy Pacing (Multi-Book)

**Book 1:**
- Power: -3 → 0 (journey to competence)
- Stakes: 4 → 7 (local to regional threat)
- World: Introduce basics
- Trust: Form party

**Book 2:**
- Power: 0 → +2 (mastery)
- Stakes: 7 → 9 (regional to global)
- World: Deepen complexity
- Trust: Test and prove

**Book 3:**
- Power: +2 → +3 (peak)
- Stakes: 9 → 10 → 3 (climax and resolution)
- World: Reveal deepest secrets
- Trust: Ultimate sacrifice

### Single Book Fantasy

**Act 1:** Power growth begins, stakes establish
**Act 2:** Power tested, stakes escalate, trust forms
**Act 3:** Power peaks, stakes resolve, trust proven

**Velocity:**
- Power: +0.5 to 1 point per major section
- Stakes: +1-2 points per act
- World: Gradual reveal throughout

---

## Fantasy Beat Mapping

**Dimensional configurations for key beats:**

1. **Ordinary World:** power=-3, stakes=2, simple world
2. **Call to Adventure:** stakes spike to 6-7, info asymmetry increases
3. **Refusal:** goal_misalignment (don't want quest)
4. **Acceptance:** goal_alignment increases, journey begins
5. **Tests:** power grows, trust built, world revealed
6. **Ordeal:** power tested, trust tested, stakes peak
7. **Reward:** power increase earned, knowledge gained
8. **Return Journey:** bringing power/knowledge back
9. **Resurrection:** final test, all dimensions peak
10. **Master of Two Worlds:** power high, stakes resolved, trust proven

## Quick Diagnostic Questions

**Power growth feels unearned?**
- Check: Is there a catalyst for each jump ≥ 2 points?
- Check: Is there struggle before breakthrough?

**Stakes feel flat?**
- Check: Did they escalate properly (personal → global)?
- Check: Are they concrete and specific?

**Fellowship feels generic?**
- Check: Is trust tested or static?
- Check: Do companions have individual arcs?

**World overwhelming?**
- Check: Is world_complexity revealed gradually?
- Check: Is worldbuilding serving the story or dominating it?

**Magic feels like deus ex machina?**
- Check: Are magic's rules established early?
- Check: Does magic solve problems too easily?

**Romance subplot feels tagged on?**
- Check: Does relationship affect fantasy plot?
- Check: Does fantasy plot affect relationship?
