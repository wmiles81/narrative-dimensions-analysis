# Thriller Genre Guide

Dimensional analysis for thriller and suspense narratives.

## Core Thriller Requirements

### Ending Requirements

**Danger Resolution (one of):**
- **Danger ≤ 3** (threat eliminated), OR
- **Acceptance ≥ 8** (character has made peace with ongoing danger)

**Throughout:**
- **Danger ≥ 7** sustained for majority of story
- **Stakes ≥ 8** sustained (serious consequences always present)
- **Trust: variable** (unreliable is okay and often preferred)

**Why acceptance as alternative:**
Some thrillers end with "the danger remains but protagonist has changed their relationship to it" (psychological thrillers, noir). Acceptance dimension tracks this psychological peace.

## Universal Thriller Pattern

```
Act 1 (0-25%): Normal World → Inciting Danger → Commitment
Act 2 (25-75%): Escalation → False Security → Betrayal
Act 3 (75-100%): Maximum Danger → Final Battle → Resolution
```

**Dimensional trajectory:**
- **Danger:** Spikes, plateaus, spikes higher
- **Stakes:** Escalate in discrete jumps (not gradual)
- **Trust:** Highly variable, often betrayed
- **Info Asymmetry:** High early, revelations at key moments

## Key Thriller Beats

### 0-10% - Normal World
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
danger: 0-2 (safe)
stakes: 2-4 (normal life)
trust: 5-7 (baseline relationships)
info_asymmetry: low
```

**Purpose:** Establish what's at risk, what will be disrupted

---

### 10-15% - Inciting Incident
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
danger: 0 → 6-7 (sudden spike, catalyst event)
stakes: 3 → 7-8 (escalation)
info_asymmetry: increases (mystery introduced)
```

**Examples:** Murder witnessed, threat received, conspiracy discovered

---

### 25% - Point of No Return
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
danger: locked at 7+ (cannot retreat to safety)
stakes: 8+ (too invested to back out)
goal_alignment: solidifies (mission clear)
```

**Dimensional Lock:** From here, danger cannot drop below 6 until climax

---

### 50% - False Victory
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
danger: temporarily drops to 4-5 (seems handled)
stakes: still high but feels manageable
trust: often at temporary high
info_asymmetry: seems resolved (wrong)
```

**Critical:** This is setup for reversal. Must be convincing enough that reader relaxes.

---

### 60-70% - Reversal / Betrayal
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
danger: 4 → 9 (worse than before)
trust: 7 → 1 (ally betrays or revealed as threat)
stakes: 8 → 10 (now personal)
info_asymmetry: reveals were incomplete
```

**Examples:** Trusted ally is villain, hero was wrong about threat, backup plan fails

---

### 75-85% - Dark Night / Maximum Danger
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
danger: 9-10 (peak physical threat)
stakes: 10 (everything on the line)
trust: 0-2 (alone or uncertain)
power_differential: -3 to -5 (outmatched)
vulnerability: high (exposed, cornered)
```

**This is thriller's "black moment"** - lowest point, highest danger

---

### 85-95% - Final Battle
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
danger: 10 (life or death)
stakes: 10 (ultimate confrontation)
power_differential: shifts (finding leverage)
trust: either rebuilds or irrelevant (self-reliance)
```

**Dimensional Movement:** Rapid, high-velocity scene

---

### 95-100% - Resolution
**Dimensional Signature (Option A - Threat Eliminated):**
```
danger: 10 → 0-3 (eliminated)
stakes: can lower
trust: resolved or acknowledged
info_asymmetry: ≤ 2 (truth known)
```

**Dimensional Signature (Option B - Acceptance):**
```
danger: remains 4-6 (world is dangerous)
acceptance: 8-10 (character at peace with it)
stakes: moderate (learned to live with risk)
trust: modified expectations
```

## Subgenre Variations

### Psychological Thriller

**Key Dimensions:**
- **Information Asymmetry:** Primary driver
- **Trust:** Wildly variable and unreliable
- **Reality Ambiguity:** Optional dimension for gaslighting/unreliable narrator

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Trust fluctuates dramatically (can't rely on anyone, including protagonist)
- Info asymmetry between characters AND between reader and truth
- Stakes compound rather than linear growth
- Power shifts unexpectedly

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Early: trust=6, info_asym=8, danger=4, reality=7 (unsure what's real)
Mid: trust=2, info_asym=9, danger=6, reality=5 (gaslighting peak)
End: trust=4, info_asym=1, danger=3, reality=9 (truth revealed)
```

**Critical Elements:**
- At least one major trust betrayal
- Information reveals change reader's understanding
- Internal danger (psychology) as important as external
- Ambiguity maintained until late (70%+)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Revealing truth too early
- Making protagonist too unreliable (reader loses investment)
- Info dumps instead of gradual revelation

---

### Action Thriller

**Key Dimensions:**
- **Danger ≥ 7** sustained throughout
- **Physical Proximity:** Varies wildly (chase dynamics)
- **Stakes ≥ 8:** High from early, stay high
- **Trust built through shared danger**

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Danger spikes and plateaus (never drops below 6)
- Stakes escalate in discrete jumps at each act
- Proximity forced by circumstances
- Trust earned through action, not words

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Early: danger=7, stakes=8, proximity=varies, trust=3
Mid: danger=8, stakes=9, proximity=forced, trust=6 (proven through action)
Climax: danger=10, stakes=10, proximity=10, trust=8 (partnership solidified)
```

**Pacing:**
- Maintain velocity ≥ 2 on some dimension (never static)
- Danger cycles: spike → plateau → spike higher
- Brief respite scenes (danger drops to 5-6) to let reader breathe

**Critical Elements:**
- At least 3 major danger spikes (setpieces)
- Each spike higher than last
- Trust built through competence and sacrifice
- Stakes are clear and visceral

**Common Mistakes:**
- Constant 10-level danger (reader numbness)
- Dropping stakes mid-story (loses urgency)
- Trust developed through dialogue instead of action

---

### Domestic Thriller

**Key Dimensions:**
- **Information Asymmetry:** Between partners/family members
- **Trust:** Central arc (building or breaking)
- **Danger:** Often psychological or intimate (4-7 range)
- **Proximity:** Forced high (living together)

**Unique Dynamic:**
- Danger from someone close (claustrophobic)
- Cannot easily escape (proximity locked high)
- Social stakes as important as physical danger
- Trust is central question

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Early: trust=7, danger=2, proximity=10, info_asym=6 (normal marriage with secrets)
Mid: trust=4, danger=5, proximity=10, info_asym=8 (discovering partner's lies)
Late: trust=1, danger=8, proximity=10, info_asym=2 (threat revealed, trapped together)
```

---

## Tension Engineering for Thrillers

### Maximum Tension Configuration
```
danger: 9-10            (immediate threat)
stakes: 10              (life or death)
trust: 0-2              (alone or betrayed)
power_differential: -4  (outmatched)
info_asymmetry: 6-8     (don't know full picture)
proximity: forced (0 or 10)  (either trapped together or separated from help)
```

**Result:** Peak thriller intensity

---

### Sustained High Tension
```
danger: 7-8             (constant threat)
stakes: 8-9             (serious consequences)
trust: 3-5              (uncertain alliances)
info_asymmetry: 6-7     (pieces missing)
power_differential: -2  (at disadvantage)
```

**Result:** Can maintain for extended sequences without reader fatigue

---

### False Security (Setup for Spike)
```
danger: 4-5             (seems handled)
stakes: 6-7             (lowering slightly)
trust: 6-7              (ally seems reliable)
info_asymmetry: 3-4     (think we know the truth)
```

**Result:** Reader relaxes, making next spike more effective

---

## Pacing Guidelines

### Thriller Pacing Rules

**Never Static:**
- Minimum velocity = 2 points total movement per scene
- Never more than 1 chapter without significant dimensional change
- Danger or stakes must move every 2-3 chapters

**Spike Pattern:**
```
Chapters 1-3: Danger climbs 3 → 7
Chapters 4-5: Danger plateaus at 7
Chapters 6-7: Danger spikes to 9
Chapters 8-9: Brief drop to 6 (false security)
Chapters 10-11: Danger spikes to 10 (climax)
```

**Velocity by Act:**
- Act 1: 3-4 points/chapter (rapid setup)
- Act 2: 2-3 points/chapter (sustained pressure)
- Act 3: 4-6 points/chapter (rapid escalation)

### Rest Beats

Even thrillers need breathing room:

**Mini-Rest (every 3-4 high-intensity chapters):**
- Drop danger to 5-6 (not eliminated, just managed)
- Lower tension through intimacy or trust building
- Process information (lower info asymmetry)
- 1-2 chapters maximum

**Purpose:** Prevents reader numbness, allows emotional processing

---

## Common Thriller Pitfalls

### Plateau Danger
**Problem:** Constant high stakes create numbness

**Dimensional Diagnosis:**
```
Chapters 1-15: danger=9, stakes=10 (never changes)
```

**Result:** Reader desensitized, no peaks feel special

**Solution:** Create waves
```
Chapter 1: danger=7
Chapter 3: danger=9 (spike)
Chapter 5: danger=6 (brief relief)
Chapter 7: danger=10 (bigger spike)
```

---

### Trust Whiplash
**Problem:** Trust fluctuates unrealistically

**Example:**
```
Chapter 4: trust=8 (best friends)
Chapter 5: trust=0 (suspected traitor)
Chapter 6: trust=9 (friends again)
```

**Why It Fails:** Readers can't invest emotionally if trust swings wildly without cause

**Solution:** Earn each trust shift with catalyst events
- Drop requires betrayal or evidence
- Recovery requires proof and time

---

### Convenient Proximity
**Problem:** Characters always in right place at right time

**Dimensional Error:** Proximity changes without justification

**Solution:** Force proximity through story logic
- Trapped together (disaster, lockdown)
- Forced partnership (only people who can help each other)
- Pursuit (hunter forces closeness)

---

### Unclear Stakes
**Problem:** Reader doesn't know what's at risk

**Dimensional Diagnosis:** Stakes are high (8-10) but vague

**Solution:** Make stakes specific and visceral
- Not: "The world is at stake" (abstract)
- Instead: "If he fails, his daughter dies" (concrete)

---

## Information Management

### The Information Curve

Thrillers rely on controlling what reader knows:

**Mystery to Reader (separate from info asymmetry between characters):**

```
0-25%: Mystery high (8-10) - Reader knows little
25-50%: Partial reveals (6-7) - Some answers, more questions
50-75%: Accelerating revelation (4-6) - Pieces coming together
75-90%: Major reveals (2-4) - Truth emerging
90-100%: Resolution (0-2) - Full picture clear
```

**Pacing Rule:** Each reveal should raise new questions until 75% mark

**Example:**
- Reveal: He's not the killer (info asymmetry drops)
- But: Then who is? And why frame him? (new questions raised)

### Dramatic Irony vs Suspense

**Dramatic Irony:** Reader knows more than character
- Info asymmetry high between character and reader
- Creates tension from "they don't know!"
- Example: Reader knows killer is in the house

**Suspense:** Reader and character discover together
- Info asymmetry shared (both don't know)
- Creates tension from uncertainty
- Example: Reader and character both don't know who the killer is

**Both are valid.** Choose based on effect wanted.

---

## Modifier Impacts

### Political Thriller
**Dimensional Additions:**
- **Power Differential:** Central (fighting powerful forces)
- **Stakes:** Often global (8-10)
- **Info Asymmetry:** Conspiracy elements high
- **Trust:** Institution betrayal common

**Pattern:** Individual (-5 power) vs institution (+5 power)

---

### Medical Thriller
**Dimensional Additions:**
- **Danger:** Disease/contamination (environmental)
- **Stakes:** Often many lives (9-10)
- **Info Asymmetry:** Scientific mystery
- **Proximity:** Quarantine (forced high)

**Pattern:** Race against time (stakes escalate with timeline)

---

### Spy Thriller
**Dimensional Focus:**
- **Info Asymmetry:** Central (secrets, intelligence)
- **Trust:** Core question (who's loyal?)
- **Identity:** Double/triple agents
- **Power:** Competing agencies

**Pattern:** Multiple reversals of trust and info reveals

---

## Thriller Beat Mapping

**Dimensional configurations for key beats:**

1. **Normal World:** danger=0-2, stakes=2-4
2. **Inciting Incident:** danger spikes to 6-7, stakes to 7
3. **Point of No Return:** danger locks at 7+, cannot retreat
4. **Rising Danger:** incremental spikes (7 → 8 → 9)
5. **False Victory:** temporary drop (9 → 5)
6. **Reversal:** spike higher than before (5 → 10)
7. **Dark Night:** danger=10, power_diff=-5, trust=0
8. **Final Battle:** danger=10, all dimensions peak
9. **Resolution:** danger=0-3 OR acceptance=8+

## Quick Diagnostic Questions

**Tension flagging?**
- Check: Is danger static? (Need spikes)
- Check: Are stakes clear and specific?

**Feels predictable?**
- Check: Info asymmetry too low too early?
- Check: Need trust betrayal or reversal?

**Exhausting to read?**
- Check: Danger constantly maxed? (Need valleys)
- Check: Any rest beats? (Lower danger briefly every 3-4 chapters)

**Ending feels flat?**
- Check: Danger resolved to ≤ 3? Or acceptance ≥ 8?
- Check: Info asymmetry resolved? (Reader knows truth)
- Check: Stakes paid off? (Consequences shown)

**Characters feel like puppets?**
- Check: Do they have agency? (Power differential not always -5)
- Check: Do they make meaningful choices? (Goal alignment matters)
