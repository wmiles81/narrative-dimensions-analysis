# Romance Genre Guide

Dimensional analysis for romance and its subgenres.

## Core Romance Requirements

### Ending Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

**HEA (Happily Ever After) or HFN (Happy For Now):**
- **Intimacy:** ≥ 8 (deep emotional connection)
- **Trust:** ≥ 7 (strong belief in reliability)
- **Goal Alignment:** ≥ 8 (want the same future)
- **Power Differential:** -1 to +1 (balanced, equal partnership)

**Why these numbers?**
- Below intimacy 8 = not convinced they're truly bonded
- Below trust 7 = reader worries it won't last
- Below goal alignment 8 = incompatible life paths
- Power differential outside ±1 = unhealthy dynamic

### Universal Romance Pattern

```
Act 1 (0-25%): Meet → Attraction → Connection
Act 2 (25-75%): Deepening → Conflict → Crisis
Act 3 (75-100%): Black Moment → Resolution → HEA
```

**Dimensional trajectory:**
- **Intimacy:** Steady climb with 1-2 setbacks
- **Trust:** Sawtooth pattern (build-break-rebuild)
- **Desire:** High early, dips at black moment, returns for finale
- **Goal Alignment:** Starts low/medium, grows steadily

## Key Romance Beats

### 25% - First Real Connection
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
intimacy: jumps 2+ points (catalyst required)
vulnerability: increases (walls starting to come down)
proximity: often high (physical closeness)
desire: already present or spikes here
```

**Examples:** First vulnerable conversation, first kiss, moment of genuine understanding

---

### 50% - False Victory
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
intimacy: 6-7 (strong but not complete)
trust: peaks temporarily (6-8)
goal_alignment: 7-8 (seems aligned)
stakes: moderate (4-6)
```

**Examples:** "I love you" said, commitment made, problem seemingly solved

**Danger:** If you end here, it feels unearned. Must test this.

---

### 75% - Black Moment
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
intimacy: 7 → 3-4 (emotional distance)
trust: 8 → 0-2 (shattered)
goal_alignment: 8 → 0-3 (opposing or broken)
stakes: 9-10 (everything on the line)
desire: remains 6+ (maintains reader investment)
vulnerability: 9-10 (emotionally raw, exposed)
```

**Critical:** Must threaten the core romance promise. Cannot be easily fixable.

---

### 90% - Grand Gesture
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
vulnerability: 10 (complete emotional nakedness)
stakes: 9-10 (putting everything on the line)
goal_alignment: begins to shift back
intimacy: begins recovery
```

**Examples:** Public declaration, life-changing sacrifice, ultimate truth shared

---

### 95-100% - HEA Resolution
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
intimacy: 8-10
trust: 7-10
goal_alignment: 8-10
power_differential: 0 (±1)
stakes: can lower to personal/sustainable level
proximity: high and sustainable
vulnerability: 7-8 (open but not raw)
```

## Subgenre Variations

### Contemporary Romance

**Ending Requirements:**
- Intimacy ≥ 8
- Trust ≥ 7
- Goal Alignment ≥ 8
- Power Differential: -1 to 1

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Steady intimacy climb with 1-2 setbacks
- Trust follows sawtooth (build-break-rebuild)
- Desire high early, dips at 60%, returns for finale

**Typical Obstacles:**
- Career conflicts (goal alignment)
- Trust issues from past (trust rebuilding)
- Social pressure (external dimension)
- Miscommunication (info asymmetry)

**Stakes:** Usually 6-8 (important but not life-or-death)
- Career opportunities
- Family expectations
- Personal dreams
- Relationship with others

---

### Dark Romance

**Ending Requirements:**
- Intimacy ≥ 7 (slightly lower acceptable)
- Trust ≥ 6 (qualified trust, "I trust you to be you")
- Power Differential: -2 to 2 (larger imbalance tolerated)
- **Stakes remain ≥ 5** (never fully safe)
- **Moral Ambiguity acknowledged** (not resolved)

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Power differential **oscillates** throughout (key differentiator)
- Trust builds VERY slowly
- Stakes never drop below 6
- Danger maintains baseline 4+

**Unique Dynamics:**
- **Power exchanges:** Differential flips sign (dominant becomes vulnerable, submissive takes power)
- **Trust through action:** Built by deeds not words
- **Forced vulnerability:** Occurs before chosen vulnerability
- **Desire fights self-preservation:** High desire despite danger

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Early: power_diff=+5, trust=0, stakes=10, desire=3, danger=7
Mid: power_diff=±3 (oscillating), trust=3, stakes=9, desire=7, danger=5
End: power_diff=0, trust=6, stakes=6, desire=10, danger=4
```

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Dropping danger too low (loses dark edge)
- Balancing power too early (loses tension)
- Building trust too quickly (unearned)

---

### Enemies to Lovers

**Ending Requirements:**
- **Goal Alignment ≥ 8** (complete flip from start)
- Trust ≥ 7
- Intimacy ≥ 8

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- **Goal Alignment: SLOWEST dimension** (key characteristic)
- Desire high despite low trust (conflict)
- Respect builds before affection
- Power differential neutralizes gradually

**Five Phases:**

**1. Active Opposition (0-20%)**
```
goal_alignment: 0-2 (opposed)
desire: 0-3 (denied or absent)
trust: 0-2 (enemies)
intimacy: 0-1 (strangers/rivals)
```

**2. Reluctant Alliance (20-40%)**
```
goal_alignment: 3-5 (temporarily aligned)
desire: 3-5 (noticing each other)
trust: 2-4 (uneasy cooperation)
respect: emerging
```

**3. Respect Emergence (40-60%)**
```
goal_alignment: 5-6 (finding common ground)
desire: 5-7 (attraction admitted internally)
trust: 4-6 (proven somewhat reliable)
intimacy: 4-5 (seeing beyond surface)
```

**4. Wall Dissolution (60-80%)**
```
goal_alignment: 6-8 (mostly aligned)
desire: 7-9 (strong attraction)
trust: 5-7 (growing)
vulnerability: increasing
intimacy: 6-8 (deep connection forming)
```

**5. True Partnership (80-100%)**
```
goal_alignment: 8-10 (complete alignment)
desire: 8-10
trust: 7-10
intimacy: 8-10
```

**Critical Error:** Making them stop being enemies too quickly. Goal alignment must be the last major dimension to shift.

---

### Serial Killer Romance

**Ending Requirements:**
- Intimacy ≥ 6 (lower than standard romance)
- Trust ≥ 5 (qualified: "I trust you to be you, including dangerous")
- **Information Asymmetry resolves ≤ 3** (the truth must come out)
- **Moral Ambiguity remains ≥ 7** (reader must accept ethical complexity)
- Danger never fully resolves (baseline 3-4)

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- **Info asymmetry extreme (8-10) until 70% mark**
- **"The Reveal" causes dimensional earthquake**
- Post-reveal: complete recalibration
- Trust rebuilds on new, darker foundation

**Critical Moments:**

**1. Discovery Scene (65-75%)**
```
info_asymmetry: 10 → 0 (crashed)
trust: 6 → 0 (shattered)
intimacy: 7 → 2 (everything was lie?)
stakes: 10 (life or death decision)
danger: 10 (immediate threat)
vulnerability: 10 (completely exposed)
```

**2. Choice Point (75-85%)**
```
moral_ambiguity: 9-10 (no clear right choice)
stakes: 10 (accept or reject, life-changing)
goal_alignment: ? (discovering new truth)
```

**3. New Normal (85-100%)**
```
intimacy: rebuilds to 6-7 (different intimacy)
trust: rebuilds to 5-6 (qualified trust)
info_asymmetry: ≤ 3 (honesty now)
moral_ambiguity: 7-9 (accepted not resolved)
danger: 3-5 (present but managed)
```

**Why It Works:**
- Total honesty post-reveal (info asymmetry ≤ 3)
- Reader understands the killer's why (not justifies, but understands)
- Love interest makes informed choice (agency preserved)
- Moral ambiguity acknowledged (reader must be okay with gray areas)

## Common Romance Pitfalls

### The Unearned HEA
**Problem:** Jump to ending coordinates without proper journey

**Dimensional Diagnosis:**
```
Chapter 15: intimacy=4, trust=3
Chapter 16: intimacy=9, trust=8 (how?!)
```

**Solution:** Map the path. Show intermediate steps. Add catalyst events for jumps ≥ 3 points.

---

### Third Act Breakup
**Problem:** Artificial trust crash at 80% that feels manufactured

**Dimensional Diagnosis:**
```
Chapter 20: trust=8, intimacy=8, aligned=9 (seems resolved)
Chapter 21: trust=1, intimacy=4 (because of misunderstanding)
```

**Why It Fails:** If the only thing breaking them up is "didn't talk to each other," it's not a real obstacle.

**Better Approach:** Make the black moment threaten something fundamental:
- Opposing core values (goal alignment actually incompatible)
- Real betrayal (not misunderstanding)
- External force with real consequences (stakes-driven)

---

### Cardboard Conflict
**Problem:** Only one dimension creating all the tension

**Example:** All conflict from info asymmetry (secrets), but:
```
goal_alignment: 10 (want same thing)
power_differential: 0 (equal)
stakes: 3 (not much at risk)
```

**Result:** "Just tell each other!" frustration from readers

**Solution:** Layer multiple dimensional tensions:
```
goal_alignment: 5 (opposing career paths)
power_differential: +3 (boss/employee dynamic)
stakes: 7 (both careers on the line)
info_asymmetry: 5 (some secrets but not only source)
```

---

## Tension Engineering for Romance

### High Tension Configuration
```
desire: 9              (want each other intensely)
proximity: 3           (forced apart)
vulnerability: 8       (emotionally exposed)
trust: 3               (uncertain)
stakes: 7-8            (relationship/career/family at risk)
goal_alignment: 4      (want to be together but life paths conflict)
```

**Result:** Reader feels the pull and the obstacles

---

### Satisfying Low Tension (HEA)
```
desire: 8              (strong attraction)
proximity: 9           (together)
vulnerability: 7       (open and comfortable)
trust: 9               (secure)
stakes: 4              (normal life stakes)
goal_alignment: 9      (shared future)
```

**Result:** Reader feels the satisfaction and security

---

## Pacing Guidelines

### Slow Burn Romance
- **Intimacy velocity:** ≤ 0.5 points/chapter
- **Trust velocity:** ≤ 0.5 points/chapter
- High page time spent at lower intimacy levels (3-6)
- Desire high but unacted upon

**Example Arc:**
```
Chapter 1: intimacy=1
Chapter 5: intimacy=2
Chapter 10: intimacy=4
Chapter 15: intimacy=6
Chapter 20: intimacy=8
```

---

### Insta-Love / Fast-Burn
- **Intimacy velocity:** ≥ 2 points/chapter
- **Trust lags behind** (creates tension despite high intimacy)
- Desire spikes immediately

**Example Arc:**
```
Chapter 1: intimacy=1, desire=8, trust=1
Chapter 2: intimacy=4, desire=9, trust=2
Chapter 3: intimacy=7, desire=10, trust=3
```

**Critical:** Trust must build through action to earn the quick intimacy

---

### Standard Romance Pacing
- **1-1.5 points/chapter** on 2-3 dimensions
- Variety in which dimensions move
- Build → test → rebuild pattern

---

## Modifiers and Their Impact

### Mafia Romance
**Dimensional Impact:**
- Power differential baseline +2 (mafia vs civilian)
- Danger baseline +3 (violent world)
- Stakes include family/loyalty (≥7)
- Trust complicated by omertà (secrets)

**Ending Adjustment:**
- Trust ≥ 6 acceptable (qualified trust)
- Danger never drops below 3 (violent world remains)

---

### Captive/Kidnapping Romance
**Dimensional Impact:**
- **Proximity forced to 9-10** (cannot escape)
- **Power differential extreme** (±5 initially)
- Stockholm progression possible (intimacy before trust)

**Trajectory:**
```
Start: power_diff=+5, proximity=10, trust=0, intimacy=0, desire=0
Mid: power_diff=+3, proximity=10, trust=2, intimacy=4, desire=6 (stockholm)
End: power_diff=0, proximity=9, trust=6, intimacy=7, desire=9
```

**Critical:** Power must equalize for healthy HEA

---

### Second Chance Romance
**Dimensional Impact:**
- **Start with trust deficit** (3-4 instead of 0)
- **Shared history affects all dimensions** (past intimacy remembered)
- **Faster intimacy, slower trust** (know each other but broken)

**Starting State:**
```
intimacy: 2 (emotionally distant now)
trust: 2 (broken by past)
info_asymmetry: 3 (know each other well)
shared_history: high (past intimacy remembered)
```

**Trajectory:** Trust rebuilding is central arc

---

## Romance Beat Mapping

**Dimensional configurations for standard beats:**

1. **Meet:** intimacy=0, all dimensions low except possibility
2. **Attraction:** desire spikes to 5-7
3. **First Connection:** intimacy +2, vulnerability +2
4. **Deepening:** trust building steadily
5. **First Conflict:** goal misalignment revealed
6. **Retreat:** proximity decreases, walls go back up
7. **Pursuit:** vulnerability increases despite fear
8. **False Victory:** temporary high alignment
9. **Black Moment:** trust/intimacy/alignment crash
10. **Grand Gesture:** vulnerability maximum (10)
11. **Resolution:** all dimensions align
12. **HEA:** stable high configuration

## Quick Diagnostic Questions

**Scene feels flat?**
- Check: Are any dimensions moving? (Need 2-3)

**Development feels rushed?**
- Check: Any jumps ≥ 3 without catalyst?

**Black moment feels weak?**
- Check: Did trust drop to ≤ 2? Stakes ≥ 8? Multiple dimensions crashed?

**Ending feels unsatisfying?**
- Check: Intimacy ≥ 8? Trust ≥ 7? Goal alignment ≥ 8? Power balanced?

**Chemistry lacking?**
- Check: Desire high? Proximity varying? Vulnerability present? Some mystery?
