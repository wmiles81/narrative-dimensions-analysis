# Mystery Genre Guide

Dimensional analysis for mystery narratives.

## Core Mystery Requirements

### Ending Requirements

**Information Resolution (mandatory):**
- **Information Asymmetry ≤ 2** (truth revealed to characters)
- **Mystery (to reader) ≤ 2** (truth revealed to reader)
- All major questions answered
- Solution must be fair (clues present in story)

**Throughout:**
- **Information Asymmetry** is primary driver (8-10 early)
- **Fair play:** Reader has access to same clues as detective
- **Stepwise reduction:** Info asymmetry reduces gradually with clues

**Why these requirements:**
Mystery is fundamentally about revealing hidden information. An unsolved mystery is a broken promise to the reader.

## Universal Mystery Pattern

```
Act 1 (0-25%): Crime → Investigation Begins → Initial Clues
Act 2 (25-75%): Gathering Evidence → Red Herrings → Pattern Recognition
Act 3 (75-100%): Confrontation → Revelation → Resolution
```

**Dimensional trajectory:**
- **Info Asymmetry:** Starts 8-10, reduces stepwise, ends 0-2
- **Trust in suspects:** Fluctuates as evidence shifts
- **Stakes:** Depends on subgenre (cozy vs noir)
- **Danger:** Depends on subgenre (cozy low, noir high)

## Key Mystery Beats

### 0-10% - The Crime
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
info_asymmetry: 0 → 8-10 (mystery introduced)
stakes: established (depends on crime severity)
danger: varies by subgenre
mystery: 10 (nothing known yet)
```

**Examples:** Murder discovered, theft revealed, disappearance noticed

---

### 10-25% - Investigation Begins
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
info_asymmetry: 10 (maximum unknown)
goal_alignment: detective focused on truth
trust: establishing baseline with suspects
mystery: 9-10 (initial questions)
```

**Setup Phase:** Introduce suspects, establish what's unknown

---

### 25-50% - Clue Gathering
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
info_asymmetry: 10 → 7 (reducing stepwise)
mystery: 9 → 6 (some answers, more questions)
trust: fluctuates with each suspect
```

**Each clue should:**
- Reduce info asymmetry by 0.5-1 point
- Often raise new questions (introduce new asymmetry)
- Shift suspicion (trust in suspects fluctuates)

**Example progression:**
```
Chapter 5: Clue found → info_asym: 9 → 8.5
Chapter 7: Interview reveals → info_asym: 8.5 → 8
Chapter 9: Evidence discovered → info_asym: 8 → 7
But: New question raised → info_asym: 7 → 7.5
```

---

### 50-60% - Red Herrings Peak
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
info_asymmetry: seems reducing but false leads
trust: in wrong suspect peaks (7-8)
mystery: plateau (seems stuck)
```

**Purpose:** Temporary increase in asymmetry, misdirection

---

### 60-75% - Pattern Recognition
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
info_asymmetry: 7 → 4 (accelerating reduction)
mystery: 6 → 3 (connections forming)
trust: realigning to actual culprit
stakes: often increase (getting close to truth)
```

**Breakthrough moment:** Multiple clues connect, paradigm shift

---

### 75-85% - Confrontation
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
info_asymmetry: 4 → 2 (nearly complete picture)
mystery: 2 (reader knows or strongly suspects)
danger: may spike (confronting killer)
stakes: peak (resolution imminent)
```

---

### 85-100% - Revelation & Resolution
**Dimensional Signature:**
```
info_asymmetry: 2 → 0 (full reveal)
mystery: 0-1 (all questions answered)
trust: validated or destroyed
danger: resolved
```

**The Reveal:**
- Must explain all clues
- Must be logical from evidence
- No new information introduced here
- Reader should be able to solve it (fair play)

## Subgenre Variations

### Cozy Mystery

**Requirements:**
- **Information Asymmetry:** Primary driver (starts 8-10)
- **Stakes:** Moderate (3-6, personal not global)
- **Danger ≤ 3** (amateur detective, safe)
- **Community trust:** Important dimension

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Info asymmetry reduces stepwise with clues
- Trust in suspects fluctuates
- Stakes personal not life-threatening
- Resolution satisfying and complete (all questions answered)

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Start: info_asym=10, stakes=5, danger=2, trust_in_community=6
Mid: info_asym=6, stakes=5, danger=2, trust_fluctuates
End: info_asym=0, stakes=3, danger=1, trust_restored=7
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Amateur or professional detective in small setting
- Emphasis on puzzle-solving over danger
- Relationship dynamics important
- Often has series regulars (ongoing relationships)

**Common Stakes:**
- Community reputation
- Personal relationships
- Professional standing
- Justice for victim (emotional, not survival)

**Pacing:**
- Information reveals: -1 point/chapter steady
- No long plateaus (always some progress)
- Red herrings are brief detours, not extended

**Common Mistakes:**
- Making danger too high (breaks cozy contract)
- Leaving subplots unresolved
- Too many suspects (reader can't track)
- Unfair clues (withholding from reader)

---

### Noir Mystery

**Requirements:**
- **Trust uniformly low (≤ 4)** - everyone's compromised
- **Moral Ambiguity high (≥ 7)** - no clean hands
- **Information costly to obtain** - each answer has price
- **No clean resolutions** - truth doesn't make things better

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Trust erodes further as investigation continues
- Every answer raises darker questions
- Power differential matters (corruption, powerlessness)
- Cynicism increases

**Dimensional Example:**
```
Start: info_asym=10, trust=4, moral_ambiguity=6, stakes=7
Mid: info_asym=7, trust=2, moral_ambiguity=8, stakes=8
End: info_asym=1, trust=1, moral_ambiguity=9, stakes=6
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Everyone has something to hide
- Truth often makes situation worse
- Detective compromised or damaged
- Resolution answers questions but doesn't fix things

**Unique Dynamics:**
- **Information asymmetry** decreases but satisfaction doesn't increase
- **Trust** in everyone (including self) decreases
- **Moral ambiguity** increases with each revelation
- **Acceptance** becomes important (accepting dark truth)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Making detective too heroic (breaks noir tone)
- Clean resolution (noir should be messy)
- Trust rebuilding at end (stay cynical)

---

### Police Procedural

**Requirements:**
- **Team dynamics** (multiple trust relationships)
- **Process matters** (goal alignment on procedure)
- **Information** gathered systematically
- **Danger** moderate (depends on crime type)

**Trajectory Pattern:**
- Info asymmetry reduces through systematic investigation
- Team trust stable (established dynamics)
- Procedure creates structure
- Stakes often high (serious crimes)

**Dimensional Focus:**
- **Information Asymmetry:** Primary
- **Goal Alignment:** Team coordination
- **Trust:** Within team vs. suspects
- **Stakes:** Usually 6-9 (serious crimes)

**Pacing:**
- Methodical information gathering
- Multiple subplots (team members)
- Procedural beats create rhythm

---

### Amateur Detective

**Requirements:**
- **Power differential:** -2 to -4 (not official authority)
- **Stakes:** Personal (victim connected to detective)
- **Information access:** Limited, must work around
- **Danger:** Moderate (5-7), amateur in over their head

**Unique Challenge:**
- Must overcome power disadvantage to get information
- Personal stakes drive investigation
- Often in conflict with official investigation (trust in authorities low)

**Dimensional Example:**
```
power_differential: -3 (civilian vs police)
info_asymmetry: 10 (no official access)
stakes: 8 (personal connection to victim)
trust_in_authorities: 3 (don't believe official conclusion)
```

---

## Information Management

### The Clue Cascade

Information should reduce in stages:

**Act 1 (0-25%):**
- Info asymmetry: 10 → 8
- Establish what's unknown
- Introduce suspects
- Set up key questions

**Act 2a (25-50%):**
- Info asymmetry: 8 → 6
- Gather clues systematically
- Each clue reduces asymmetry 0.5-1 point
- Red herrings introduce temporary increases

**Act 2b (50-75%):**
- Info asymmetry: 6 → 3
- Pattern recognition accelerates reduction
- Multiple clues connect
- Paradigm shift moments

**Act 3 (75-100%):**
- Info asymmetry: 3 → 0
- Rapid revelation
- All pieces fit together
- Complete picture emerges

### Red Herrings

**Purpose:** Temporary misdirection

**Dimensional Effect:**
```
Chapter 10: Trust in suspect A: 2 → 7 (seems guilty)
Chapter 12: New evidence → Trust in suspect A: 7 → 2 (cleared)
              Trust in suspect B: 2 → 6 (new suspect)
```

**Rules:**
- Must be fair (evidence points that way)
- Must be resolvable (doesn't contradict later)
- Temporary increase in info asymmetry
- Don't overuse (reader frustration)

### Fair Play Principle

**Reader must have access to:**
- All clues detective has
- Ability to solve mystery
- Same information at same time

**Unfair (avoid):**
- Detective has crucial info never shared with reader
- Solution depends on information introduced in reveal
- Clues withheld until convenient

**Dimensional Translation:**
- **Mystery (to reader)** should track closely with info asymmetry (between characters)
- Gap of 1-2 points acceptable (reader might solve it first)
- Gap > 3 points = unfair mystery

---

## Tension in Mystery

### Mystery-Specific Tension Formula

```
TENSION = info_asymmetry + stakes + danger +
          (trust fluctuation in suspects)
```

**Different from other genres:**
- Info asymmetry weighted heavily
- Danger less important (except noir/thriller crossover)
- Trust fluctuation creates uncertainty

### High Mystery Tension
```
info_asymmetry: 8          (major unknowns)
stakes: 7                  (matters deeply)
trust: fluctuating         (suspect shifting)
danger: varies             (depends on subgenre)
proximity: to answers      (close to breakthrough)
```

### Resolution Satisfaction
```
info_asymmetry: 0          (all revealed)
mystery: 0                 (reader satisfied)
trust: resolved            (know who's reliable)
stakes: paid off           (consequences shown)
```

## Common Mystery Pitfalls

### The Info Dump
**Problem:** Info asymmetry resolves too fast

**Dimensional Diagnosis:**
```
Chapter 15: info_asym=8
Chapter 16: info_asym=0 (dumped all at once)
```

**Why It Fails:** No gradual discovery, no reader participation

**Solution:** Graduated revelation
```
Chapter 15: info_asym=8 → 7 (one clue)
Chapter 16: info_asym=7 → 6 (another piece)
Chapter 17: info_asym=6 → 4 (connection made)
Chapter 18: info_asym=4 → 2 (pattern clear)
Chapter 19: info_asym=2 → 0 (final reveal)
```

---

### Withholding Information
**Problem:** Artificial info asymmetry maintenance

**Example:**
- Detective finds crucial clue in Chapter 5
- Not revealed to reader until Chapter 15
- No story reason for withholding

**Dimensional Error:**
```
mystery (to reader): 8 (high)
info_asymmetry (between characters): 4 (detective knows much more)
Gap = 4 (unfair)
```

**Solution:** Keep mystery and info_asymmetry within 2 points

---

### Unsatisfying Reveal
**Problem:** New information introduced at resolution

**Example:**
- Never mentioned twin brother suddenly appears
- Clue reader couldn't have known
- Solution depends on expert knowledge not established

**Why It Fails:** Breaks fair play contract

**Solution:** All solution elements present by 75%

---

### Too Many Suspects
**Problem:** Reader can't track relationships

**Dimensional Overload:**
- Tracking trust in 8+ suspects
- Info asymmetry for each
- Relationship dynamics multiply

**Rule of Thumb:**
- 3-5 serious suspects maximum
- More is okay if clearly differentiated
- Use secondary characters for misdirection not primary suspects

---

## Pacing Guidelines

### Information Velocity

**Steady reduction:**
- -1 to -1.5 points info asymmetry per chapter
- Never plateau for more than 2 chapters
- Red herrings can temporarily increase (max +1 point)

**Example good pacing:**
```
Ch 1: info_asym=10 (crime)
Ch 3: info_asym=9 (initial investigation)
Ch 5: info_asym=8 (first clues)
Ch 7: info_asym=7 (gathering evidence)
Ch 9: info_asym=6.5 (progress)
Ch 11: info_asym=5 (connections)
Ch 13: info_asym=3 (breakthrough)
Ch 15: info_asym=1 (nearly solved)
Ch 16: info_asym=0 (revelation)
```

### Trust Fluctuation Pacing

**Suspect trust should shift:**
- Every 2-3 chapters, suspicion shifts
- Not random - based on evidence
- At least 2-3 major shifts before solution

**Example:**
```
Ch 1-4: Suspect A seems guilty (trust=2)
Ch 5-8: Evidence clears A, B looks guilty (A trust=6, B trust=2)
Ch 9-12: Both seem innocent, C emerges (C trust=2)
Ch 13+: Truth emerges about actual culprit
```

## Mystery Beat Mapping

**Dimensional configurations for key beats:**

1. **Crime Discovered:** info_asym: 0 → 10, mystery: 10
2. **Investigation Begins:** establishing baseline, introducing suspects
3. **First Clues:** info_asym: 10 → 8, trust fluctuation begins
4. **Gathering Evidence:** steady reduction, info_asym: 8 → 6
5. **Red Herring Peak:** temporary trust spike in wrong suspect
6. **Stuck Point:** plateau (brief), frustration
7. **Breakthrough:** rapid reduction, info_asym: 6 → 3
8. **Confrontation:** info_asym: 3 → 1, danger may spike
9. **Revelation:** info_asym: 1 → 0, all explained
10. **Resolution:** consequences, restoration (or not, if noir)

## Hybrid Mysteries

### Mystery-Thriller
**Combine:**
- Mystery info asymmetry reduction
- Thriller danger and stakes
- Both must resolve

**Dimensional Challenge:**
- Danger ≥ 7 throughout
- Info asymmetry ≤ 2 at end
- Both tracks must feel important

---

### Mystery-Romance
**Combine:**
- Mystery investigation
- Romance relationship arc
- Both must resolve

**Dimensional Challenge:**
- Info asymmetry → 0 (mystery solved)
- Intimacy ≥ 8, trust ≥ 7 (romance HEA)
- Often: mystery resolution enables romance resolution

---

### Historical Mystery
**Add:**
- **Setting authenticity** dimension
- **Social constraints** affect investigation
- Power dynamics different (class, gender)

**Dimensional Impact:**
- Power differential often -2 to -4 (depending on detective's position)
- Social pressure affects goal pursuit
- Period-appropriate information gathering

## Quick Diagnostic Questions

**Mystery feels stuck?**
- Check: Has info asymmetry reduced in last 2 chapters?
- Check: Has trust in suspects shifted recently?

**Solution feels unfair?**
- Check: Was reader given same clues as detective?
- Check: Mystery (to reader) within 2 points of info asymmetry?

**Pacing drags?**
- Check: Info asymmetry reducing steadily (-1 per chapter)?
- Check: Trust fluctuating or static?

**Too confusing?**
- Check: Too many suspects? (Reduce to 3-5)
- Check: Too many subplots? (Focus on main mystery)

**Ending unsatisfying?**
- Check: Info asymmetry = 0? (All questions answered)
- Check: All clues explained?
- Check: Fair play maintained?
