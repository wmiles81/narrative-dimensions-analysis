## Quick Scoring Tips

### 1. Use Whole Numbers First
Don't overthink precision. Start with whole numbers (0-10), add decimals only if truly between levels.

### 2. Compare to Examples
Find the closest example in the detailed descriptions above. If between two levels, you're probably at 5 or 6.

### 3. Track Changes, Not Absolutes
What matters more: "intimacy went from 4 to 6" rather than "intimacy is exactly 5.7"

### 4. Stay Consistent
Use the same rubric throughout your analysis. Your internal consistency matters more than "perfect" scores.

### 5. Most Scenes Are 3-7 Range
- 0, 1, 2 should be rare (extreme lows)
- 9, 10 should be rare (peaks/endings)
- Most of your story lives in 3-7

### 6. Context Matters
A stakes=7 in romance (relationship on the line) is different from stakes=7 in thriller (someone might die). Calibrate to your genre.

## Common Scoring Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Conflating Dimensions**
- Intimacy ≠ Trust (you can be close but not trust)
- Desire ≠ Intimacy (you can want someone you don't know well)
- Keep each dimension distinct

**Mistake 2: Only Using Extremes**
- Don't make everything 0, 5, or 10
- Nuance lives in 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Save 0 and 10 for true extremes

**Mistake 3: Forgetting the Genre Context**
- Romance stakes=8 might be thriller stakes=5
- Calibrate to your genre's typical ranges

**Mistake 4: Overthinking**
- Trust your instinct
- "Around 5" is fine
- Patterns matter more than precision

**Mistake 5: Ignoring Movement**
- A dimension at 5 for three chapters is static (problem)
- Better: 4 → 5 → 6 (showing growth)

## When to Use Secondary Dimensions

**Always track these 9 primary:**
- Intimacy, Trust, Desire, Vulnerability, Goal Alignment, Power Differential, Information Asymmetry, Stakes, Proximity

**Add these when relevant:**

**Danger** - If writing thriller, suspense, action
**Mystery** - If writing mystery, or tracking reader knowledge vs character knowledge
**Moral Ambiguity** - If writing dark romance, noir, morally complex stories
**Social Pressure** - If external judgment is a major force (small town romance, reputation-based conflict)
**Acceptance** - If ending cannot fully resolve (tragedy, some thrillers)
**Fear/Dread** - If writing horror

## Example Scene Scoring

### Scene: First Kiss (Romance)
```
intimacy: 5 → 7        (+2 movement, catalyst event)
trust: 6                (stable)
desire: 8               (high, driving the moment)
vulnerability: 7        (both opening up)
goal_alignment: 8       (both want this)
power_differential: 0   (equal)
info_asymmetry: 3       (know each other well)
stakes: 6               (risking friendship)
proximity: 10           (in each other's arms)
```

### Scene: Betrayal Revealed (Any Genre)
```
intimacy: 7 → 4         (-3 movement, catalyst event)
trust: 8 → 1            (-7 movement, major catalyst!)
desire: 8               (still care despite hurt)
vulnerability: 9        (emotionally raw)
goal_alignment: 8 → 2   (-6 movement, now opposing)
power_differential: 0 → +3  (betrayed has moral high ground)
info_asymmetry: 2 → 0   (secret revealed)
stakes: 9               (relationship on the line)
proximity: 8            (confrontation scene)
```

## Movement Rules

**The 3-Point Rule:**
- Jumps ≥ 3 points require a catalyst event
- Jumps of 1-2 can happen gradually
- See `references/catalyst-events.md` for event types

**Minimum Movement:**
- Each scene should move 2-3 dimensions
- Static scenes (0 movement) feel flat
- Moving all 9 dimensions at once = chaos

**Velocity Sweet Spot:**
- Total movement per chapter: 3-6 points across all dimensions
- Too little (< 2): Boring, stuck
- Too much (> 8): Rushed, unearned

## Quick Reference Formula

### Tension (Simplified)
```
TENSION = stakes + info_asymmetry + (10 - goal_alignment) +
          (vulnerability - trust) + (desire - proximity) + |power_diff|
```

Higher number = higher tension

### Chemistry (Simplified)
```
CHEMISTRY = desire × proximity_variance + vulnerability + mystery
```

Desire high, proximity varying (close/far/close), some vulnerability shown, slight info asymmetry for discovery

### Conflict (Simplified)
```
CONFLICT = (10 - goal_alignment) + |power_diff| + (desire + low_proximity)
```

Wanting different things, power imbalance, wanting someone you can't be near

## Practice Exercise

Score this scene: **Two coworkers forced to work late on a project**

Context: They've worked together for 6 months, friendly but not close, one has a secret crush.

**Try scoring before looking at the answer:**

<details>
<summary>Sample Scoring</summary>

```
intimacy: 4             (coworker friendly level)
trust: 6                (reliable at work)
desire: 6 (for one)     (crush has it, other unaware)
desire: 2 (for other)   (or track separately per character)
vulnerability: 3        (professional walls up)
goal_alignment: 9       (both want to finish the project)
power_differential: 0   (coworkers, equal)
info_asymmetry: 5       (secret crush unknown)
stakes: 4               (job performance, not critical)
proximity: 8            (working late, close quarters)
```

**What creates tension?**
- (desire - proximity): (6 - 8) = -2 for crusher (close but can't act on it)
- info_asymmetry: 5 (secret)
- Low stakes keep it manageable

**What could move?**
- Vulnerability could increase (late night, guards down)
- Info asymmetry could decrease (crush revealed)
- Intimacy could grow (personal conversation)
