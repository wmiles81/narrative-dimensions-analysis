# Tropes and Modifiers

How common tropes and story modifiers affect dimensional configurations.

## Understanding Modifiers

**Modifiers** are story elements that shift baseline dimensional values or create unique trajectory patterns. They layer on top of your base genre.

**Example:**
- Base: Contemporary Romance
- Modifier: + Mafia
- Result: Mafia Romance (romance with shifted baselines)

## How to Apply Modifiers

### 1. Start with Base Genre
Identify your primary genre and its requirements.

### 2. Add Modifier Baselines
Adjust starting dimensional values based on modifier.

### 3. Track Modified Trajectories
Some dimensions move differently with modifiers.

### 4. Check Modified Endings
Some modifiers allow different ending thresholds.

## Romance Modifiers

### Mafia Romance

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Baseline Adjustments:**
```
power_differential: +2 to +4 (mafia vs civilian typical start)
danger: baseline +3 (violent world)
stakes: minimum 6 (life and death world)
moral_ambiguity: baseline +3 (criminal world)
```

**Trajectory Changes:**
- **Power differential:** Must equalize by end (healthy HEA)
- **Danger:** Never drops below 3 (violent world persists)
- **Trust:** Complicated by omertà (code of silence affects honesty)
- **Stakes:** Include family/loyalty conflicts

**Ending Requirements (Modified):**
```
intimacy: ≥ 8 (standard romance)
trust: ≥ 6 (acceptable, qualified: "I trust you in this world")
goal_alignment: ≥ 8 (standard romance)
power_differential: -1 to +1 (must equalize despite world)
danger: 3-5 acceptable (world remains violent)
```

**Example Trajectory:**
```
Start: power_diff=+4, danger=7, trust=1, intimacy=0, stakes=9
Mid: power_diff=+2, danger=6, trust=4, intimacy=6, stakes=8
End: power_diff=0, danger=4, trust=7, intimacy=9, stakes=6
```

**Common Scenarios:**
- Made man + civilian
- Rival family members
- Mafia boss + witness/captive
- Undercover + target

**Key Challenges:**
- Equalizing power (civilian gaining agency)
- Building trust (despite lies required by mafia code)
- Maintaining danger (world doesn't become safe)
- Addressing morality (acceptance of gray areas)

---

### Captive/Kidnapping Romance

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Baseline Adjustments:**
```
proximity: 9-10 (forced, cannot escape)
power_differential: +4 to +5 (captor has total control)
trust: 0 (victim of kidnapping)
intimacy: 0 (strangers or enemies)
stakes: 9-10 (survival)
danger: 7-9 (in captor's power)
```

**Trajectory Pattern (Stockholm Possible):**
```
Unusual pattern: Intimacy can grow before trust
power_differential: MUST reduce for healthy ending
proximity: Remains high, becomes chosen not forced
```

**Trajectory Example:**
```
Week 1: power_diff=+5, proximity=10, trust=0, intimacy=0, danger=9
Week 2: power_diff=+4, proximity=10, trust=1, intimacy=2, danger=7
Week 3: power_diff=+3, proximity=10, trust=2, intimacy=4, danger=6
Week 4: power_diff=+2, proximity=10, trust=4, intimacy=6, danger=4
Resolution: power_diff=0, proximity=9 (chosen), trust=7, intimacy=8, danger=2
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- **Power MUST equalize** (±1) for healthy HEA
- **Proximity becomes chosen** (Stockholm must transition to genuine)
- **Trust rebuilt on new foundation** (not just survival bond)
- **Danger resolves** (≤ 3, captivity ends)

**Stockholm Progression:**
```
Phase 1: Survival (intimacy before trust, trauma bonding)
Phase 2: Understanding (vulnerability forced, connection forms)
Phase 3: Choice Point (power shifts, captive has agency)
Phase 4: Genuine (relationship rebuilt with equal power)
```

**Ethical Boundaries:**
- Must address problematic power dynamic
- Must show genuine consent (requires power equalization)
- Must not romanticize abuse (trajectory must show transformation)
- Reader must see why captive chooses this (not just Stockholm)

---

### Second Chance Romance

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Baseline Adjustments:**
```
trust: 2-4 (broken by past, not zero because history exists)
intimacy: 2-3 (emotionally distant NOW, but past remembered)
info_asymmetry: 2-4 (know each other well)
shared_history: high (past intimacy ghosts the present)
vulnerability: 1-3 (walls up due to past hurt)
```

**Trajectory Pattern:**
```
Faster intimacy growth (know each other)
SLOWER trust rebuilding (broken, must prove)
Past memories affect all dimensions
```

**Example Trajectory:**
```
Start: intimacy=2, trust=2, vulnerability=2, info_asym=3, desire=4 (still attracted)
Mid: intimacy=5, trust=4, vulnerability=5, info_asym=2, desire=7 (rekindling)
End: intimacy=9, trust=8, vulnerability=8, info_asym=1, desire=9 (stronger than before)
```

**Key Beats:**
1. **Forced proximity:** Circumstances bring them back together
2. **Old patterns:** Fall into familiar intimacy too fast
3. **Trust break:** Something triggers old wound
4. **Working through:** Address past properly this time
5. **Stronger foundation:** Trust rebuilt, intimacy deeper

**Central Arc:**
- **Trust rebuilding is THE story**
- Must address what broke them originally
- Must show growth (why it works now)
- Must earn the second chance

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not addressing why it didn't work before
- Trust rebuilds too easily
- Characters haven't grown
- Same problems will break them again

### Enemies to Lovers

**Dimensional Pattern:**

**Starting Configuration:**
```
goal_alignment: 0-2 (opposed)
trust: 0-2 (enemies)
intimacy: 0-1 (strangers or rivals)
desire: 0-3 (denied or absent)
power_differential: varies (often balanced to create conflict)
```

**Critical Pattern:**
- **Goal Alignment is SLOWEST dimension** (last to change)
- Desire often present despite low trust (creates conflict)
- Respect builds before affection

**Five Phases:**

**Phase 1: Active Opposition (0-20%)**
```
goal_alignment: 0-2 (incompatible)
desire: 0-3 (denied)
trust: 0-2 (antagonistic)
intimacy: 0-1 (don't know each other)
```

**Phase 2: Reluctant Alliance (20-40%)**
```
goal_alignment: 3-5 (temporary alignment)
desire: 3-5 (noticing each other)
trust: 2-4 (uneasy cooperation)
respect: emerging (new dimension)
intimacy: 2-3 (learning about each other)
```

**Phase 3: Respect Emergence (40-60%)**
```
goal_alignment: 5-6 (common ground)
desire: 5-7 (admitted internally)
trust: 4-6 (proving reliable)
intimacy: 4-5 (seeing beyond surface)
respect: solid (6+)
```

**Phase 4: Wall Dissolution (60-80%)**
```
goal_alignment: 6-8 (mostly aligned but...)
desire: 7-9 (strong)
trust: 5-7 (growing)
vulnerability: increasing
intimacy: 6-8 (deep connection)
```

**Phase 5: True Partnership (80-100%)**
```
goal_alignment: 8-10 (FINALLY aligned)
desire: 8-10
trust: 7-10
intimacy: 8-10
```

**Critical Error:**
Making them stop being enemies too quickly. Goal alignment must be last major shift.

### Forbidden Romance

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Baseline Adjustments:**
```
social_pressure: 7-10 (external forces opposing)
stakes: 7-9 (being together has consequences)
proximity: often limited (forced apart)
info_asymmetry: 5-7 (hiding relationship)
```

**Tension Sources:**
```
(desire - proximity) = high (want to be together, can't)
(vulnerability - trust) = moderate (risk in being open)
stakes = high (consequences of being together)
social_pressure = constant external tension
```

**Types of Forbidden:**
- **Social:** Class difference, rival families, workplace
- **Circumstantial:** Witness protection, war, duty
- **Supernatural:** Human/vampire, immortal/mortal
- **Professional:** Boss/employee, doctor/patient, teacher/student

**Resolution Patterns:**

**Option A: Overcome**
```
social_pressure: 10 → 3 (external forces defeated/convinced)
stakes: 9 → 4 (consequences resolved)
proximity: 3 → 9 (can be together)
```

**Option B: Accept Cost**
```
social_pressure: remains high (still forbidden)
acceptance: 8-10 (peace with consequences)
stakes: paid (lost job, family estranged, etc.)
proximity: 9 (chose each other despite cost)
```

---

### Forced Proximity

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Baseline Adjustment:**
```
proximity: 8-10 (stuck together)
goal_alignment: varies (may not want to be there)
intimacy: grows faster (constant exposure)
vulnerability: forced (cannot maintain walls)
```

**Common Scenarios:**
- Snowed in / stranded
- Roommates / housemates
- Bodyguard / protection detail
- Road trip
- Workplace proximity (office, spaceship, etc.)

**Trajectory Pattern:**
```
Proximity locked high → Intimacy grows → Vulnerability forced → Trust builds or breaks
```

**Tension Creation:**
```
High proximity + low desire = irritation
High proximity + high desire + obstacles = sexual tension
High proximity + secrets = pressure cooker
```

**Example:**
```
Day 1: proximity=10, intimacy=2, vulnerability=2, desire=4, tension=moderate
Day 5: proximity=10, intimacy=4, vulnerability=5, desire=7, tension=high
Day 10: proximity=10, intimacy=7, vulnerability=8, desire=9, tension=peak
```

---

### Fake Relationship

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Starting Configuration:**
```
intimacy: low (3-4, enough to fake it)
info_asymmetry: 6-8 (hiding true feelings or reasons)
proximity: forced high (maintaining facade)
desire: varies (often secret)
vulnerability: low (guarded)
goal_alignment: 7-9 (aligned on the fake, not real feelings)
```

**Trajectory Pattern:**
```
Fake intimacy → Real intimacy
Hidden feelings → Revealed feelings
Info asymmetry → Transparency
Goal misalignment (about relationship) → Alignment
```

**Key Beats:**

**Act 1: The Deal**
```
goal_alignment: 8 (both want the fake for reasons)
intimacy: 3 (can convincingly fake it)
info_asymmetry: 7 (hiding true feelings/reasons)
```

**Act 2: Blurring Lines**
```
intimacy: 3 → 7 (fake becomes real)
desire: increasing (catching real feelings)
vulnerability: 4 → 7 (dropping guards)
info_asymmetry: still high (not admitting feelings)
```

**Act 3: Revelation**
```
info_asymmetry: 7 → 0 (feelings revealed)
trust: tested (was it ever real?)
intimacy: 7 → 9 (real foundation)
goal_alignment: about real relationship now
```

**Tension Sources:**
- (intimacy increasing - info asymmetry high) = "is this real?"
- (desire high - can't act on it) = "maintaining facade"
- (vulnerability forced - trust uncertain) = "are they faking?"

---

## Thriller/Suspense Modifiers

### Stalker

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Baseline Adjustments:**
```
info_asymmetry: 8-10 (stalker knows victim, victim doesn't know)
proximity: varies (stalker controls)
power_differential: +3 to +5 (knowledge is power)
danger: 6-9 (threat present)
vulnerability: 8-10 (victim exposed, stalker hidden)
```

**If Romance (controversial):**
Must address power and knowledge imbalances:
```
Start: info_asym=10, power_diff=+5, danger=8
Mid: info_asym=5 (victim learning), power_diff=+2, danger=5
End: info_asym=≤2 (transparency), power_diff=0, danger=≤3
```

**Critical Requirements for Romance:**
- Info asymmetry MUST resolve (no more secrets)
- Power MUST equalize
- Danger MUST resolve (no longer threatening)
- Stalking must STOP (behavior changes)

---

### Revenge Plot

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Baseline:**
```
goal_alignment: 0-2 (revenge vs. being target)
trust: 0 (one is deceiving the other)
info_asymmetry: 8-10 (revenge plot hidden)
stakes: 7-9 (serious consequences)
moral_ambiguity: 6-9 (revenge is gray area)
```

**Trajectory Options:**

**Option A: Revenge Abandoned**
```
Chapter 10: goal_align=0, info_asym=9, trust=0
Chapter 15: goal_align=3, info_asym=7, trust=2 (conflicted)
Chapter 20: goal_align=8, info_asym=1, trust=6 (chose love over revenge)
```

**Option B: Revenge Completed, Then Rebuild**
```
Chapter 15: revenge executed, info_asym=0, trust=-2 (betrayed)
Chapter 20: working through, trust=4, intimacy=5
Chapter 25: earned forgiveness, trust=7, intimacy=8
```

**Key Question:** Can trust survive the reveal?

---

## Fantasy Modifiers

### Fated Mates

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**New Dimension:**
```
fate: 8-10 (destined to be together)
```

**Trajectory Patterns:**

**Option A: Fighting Fate**
```
fate: 10 (inevitable)
acceptance: 0 (refuses)
desire: 9 (pull is real)
goal_alignment: 2 (wants to resist)
= Tension from resistance
```

**Option B: Embracing Fate**
```
fate: 10 (destined)
acceptance: 8 (embraces)
trust: growing (believing in destiny)
= Less tension, more discovery
```

**Tension Sources:**
- Fate high + acceptance low = fighting destiny
- Fate high + trust low = "is this real or just magic?"
- Fate high + goal misalignment = "I don't want what fate wants"

**Resolution:**
- Must address: Is it only fate, or is it real?
- Must show: Choice within destiny (agency preserved)

---

### Soulmate Bonds

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Magic Affecting Dimensions:**
```
intimacy: bond accelerates (may start at 5 due to magical connection)
vulnerability: forced (bond shares feelings/pain)
info_asymmetry: reduced (bond shares knowledge)
trust: complicated (do they trust bond or person?)
```

**Unique Challenge:**
```
High intimacy (bond-created) vs. Low trust (didn't choose this)
High vulnerability (bond forces) vs. Low acceptance (didn't want it)
```

**Trajectory:**
```
Start: intimacy=5 (bond), trust=2 (didn't choose), vulnerability=8 (forced)
Mid: learning to live with bond, trust=5, acceptance=6
End: intimacy=10 (genuine + bond), trust=9 (chose each other), acceptance=10
```

**Critical Arc:** From "forced by magic" to "would choose this anyway"

---

### Vampire/Immortal Romance

**Dimensional Impacts:**

**Baseline Adjustments:**
```
power_differential: +3 to +5 (immortal vs. mortal)
stakes: 9-10 (mortality, transformation, eternal consequences)
info_asymmetry: 6-8 (centuries of secrets)
danger: 5-7 (predator nature)
moral_ambiguity: 6-8 (has killed, will kill again)
```

**Key Tensions:**
```
(desire high - danger from predator nature)
(intimacy growing - info asymmetry about long past)
(power imbalanced - mortal vulnerable)
```

**Resolution Options:**

**Option A: Transformation**
```
End: power_diff=0 (mortal becomes immortal)
stakes: adjusted to new reality
danger: managed (control)
```

**Option B: Mortality Accepted**
```
End: power_diff remains but accepted
stakes: adjusted (will lose them to time)
acceptance: high (chosen anyway)
```

**Common Mistake:** Not addressing power imbalance (predator/prey dynamic)

---

## Applying Multiple Modifiers

### Example: Mafia + Second Chance + Forced Proximity

**Combined Baselines:**
```
From Mafia:
  power_diff: +3, danger: +3, moral_ambiguity: +3

From Second Chance:
  trust: 2 (broken), intimacy: 2 (distant), shared_history: high

From Forced Proximity:
  proximity: 10 (stuck together)
```

**Starting Configuration:**
```
power_differential: +3
danger: 7
moral_ambiguity: 6
trust: 2
intimacy: 2
proximity: 10
stakes: 9
```

**Combined Trajectory:**
- **Proximity forced** → Cannot avoid dealing with past
- **Mafia danger** → External pressure forces cooperation
- **Trust rebuilding** → Central arc (second chance)
- **Power must equalize** → Despite mafia world

---

## Diagnostic Questions

**Is modifier affecting the right dimensions?**
- Mafia should affect power, danger, stakes
- Second chance should affect trust, vulnerability
- Fake relationship should affect info asymmetry, intimacy

**Are baseline adjustments clear?**
- Starting values reflect the modifier
- Trajectory respects modifier constraints

**Do modifiers conflict or complement?**
- Multiple modifiers can work together
- Or create interesting tensions
- But don't overwhelm the core story

**Does ending resolve modifier complications?**
- Power imbalances addressed
- Secrets revealed
- Danger resolved or accepted
